You have your guards hold "+himher+" down, as you put a gag in "+hisher+" mouth, saying that they should be more quiet sometime. The gag has to remain within them for 12 hours before removal. Other people were in on this, and forced "+ NPCCharList.CharFollower [WorldControl.idx].charName +" to tour around your palace grounds with the toy in "+hisher+" mouth. "+ NPCCharList.CharFollower [WorldControl.idx].charName +"’s frustration leads to your enjoyment of the subject, and part of you hopes that "+heshe+" continues to run "+hisher+" mouth off and say something bad that gets her fired. Who knows? Regardless, the Gag did not win games but it did get offer to several fun moments amongst the staff at the expense of that one guy.\n\n";

The area is too dark for "+himher+" to see what it really is. As you arrive and the light comes on, "+heshe+" notices that they are above a rope saddle below them. You state to "+ NPCCharList.CharFollower [WorldControl.idx].charName +" that this is their punishment and that you hope that they will stop this foolish behavior lest they enjoy the punishments, which was responded with a heavy, strong no. \n\nThe saddle is elevated to rock against the private parts of "+ NPCCharList.CharFollower [WorldControl.idx].charName +". The machine starts slowly, but begins to build speed. "+ NPCCharList.CharFollower [WorldControl.idx].charName +" tries to hide how turned on "+heshe+" is by this stimulation but eventually has a violent orgasm based upon how the ride rubs up against his/her cock/clit. After one too many climaxes, "+ NPCCharList.CharFollower [WorldControl.idx].charName +" collapses on the ride. You free them and abandon them somewhere in town, hoping that "+heshe+" has learned their lesson. ";

While it doesn’t seem initially bad, you tell your dungeon crew to continue to keep it like this. Eventually your crew starts to sway the rope and spin "+himher+" as well, causing real dizziness. Combined with the lack of hydration and the blood rushing to "+hisher+" head, "+ NPCCharList.CharFollower [WorldControl.idx].charName +" suddenly realizes that this was going to be a valid form of torture and punishment.\n\nThe spinning and handling abruptly stop at times, leaving "+ NPCCharList.CharFollower [WorldControl.idx].charName +" to try and find balance before another wave of spinning fury begins. Eventually the torture begins to be too much and "+heshe+" blacks out from the forces. You hope this is enough of a lesson to show "+himher+" to not defy your decisions.";

Suspended above the ground, "+heshe+" is tied way too tightly. You enter the room with one of your advisors.

But this is not the main draw of tonight’s punishment.\n\nOne of your men comes in with a cloth wrapped around some things. I give the man the nod, and the cloth opens up. Inside is revealed to be an assortment of torture devices. As "+ NPCCharList.CharFollower [WorldControl.idx].charName +" begins to get squeezed harder and hard, your man gets a needle and places it at the base of "+ NPCCharList.CharFollower [WorldControl.idx].charName +"’s cock/clit, before driving the needle through, piercing it. "+ NPCCharList.CharFollower [WorldControl.idx].charName +" screams out in pain but that is not it.\n\nOne by one, your expert begins to pierce parts of "+ NPCCharList.CharFollower [WorldControl.idx].charName +"’s body, primarily through the fingers or nipples. He does not put jewelry into the holes to let them heal up, and also proceeds to pierce "+ NPCCharList.CharFollower [WorldControl.idx].charName +"’s ears, lips, and tongue. Every hole made is then washed with alcohol, much to the chagrin of "+ NPCCharList.CharFollower [WorldControl.idx].charName +".\n\nBy the end of the session, "+ NPCCharList.CharFollower [WorldControl.idx].charName +" apologizes but can barely speak due to the screams he has given off for.

The more "+heshe+" struggles, the more stimulated and horney "+heshe+" becomes. Regardless of this, "+heshe+" continues to fight the ropes. \n\nYou watch from afar as "+ NPCCharList.CharFollower [WorldControl.idx].charName +" continues to arouse and struggle "+himher+"self. Once you have made sure that all is in place, you shut the door to that room in the dungeon, isolation "+himher+" in complete silence and darkness. "+HISHER+" screams and cries for help are muffled under walls of pure solid stone.\n\n48 hours go by before you think that "+ NPCCharList.CharFollower [WorldControl.idx].charName +" has served enough punishment. The door opens and you find "+himher+" stiff and almost completely lifeless. "+HISHER+" body and genitals are completely covered in rope burns, sweat and blood dripping from "+hisher+" body, desperate to get off.

You smile at "+ NPCCharList.CharFollower [WorldControl.idx].charName +", a shell of who they used to be, a worker who should be completely obedient to "+hisher+" leader.
