You expected to hear some kind of lewd sound, but nothing happened. You can hear her voice from inside, telling you that she is busy at the moment, that you should make an appointment with her secretary. You frown and tell her that you’re the Liege and that you got what she wanted. There is a moment of silence, before she speaks again. <i>“You can enter then.”</i>After you got inside, you can see that she is taking a sip from a small cup in her desk as she stands up from the chair that she uses and walks towards you with a posture full of security and with a lewd tone in her walking, as she motions you to sit on one of the chairs that are in front of her. You sit and tell her that you finalized the conversation with the scholar that she assigned, as you can see that she sits on one of armchairs that is next to you. She nods at your answer and looks at you with a smile. \n\n<i>“Damn, Its good to see that you have enough skill to deal with someone as incompetent as Virgil. At least I can place you with out youngest graders and you wouldn’t be a complete failure, my liege. At least you got the good blood from your family, or at least better than your uncle. But it seems that you have more spine than him, not that’s something really hard if you ask me”</i> she says with a condescending tone. It seems that your uncle was a nuisance to her, which doesn’t surprise you at all, but you tell her that you’re here to do something better than that, that you want to clean the mess that your uncle did in that city. And yes, you know that sounds something quite hard to do, but someone has to start somewhere.\n\nHer movements are graceful as she reclines on the arm of the armchair that you were using. <i>“I won’t be able to take you off my back, am I?. But you have the blood of your uncle after all, its just a matter of time before you screw it up and become just like him. But I’m no one to go against the liege’s wishes. This city is at the brink of extinction, who am I to stop the last push to the abyss?”</i> After saying that, she places a hand over her forehead in a dramatic way.\n\nShe sighs from her current position. <i>“Your uncle was instructed by the Citadel, that the education had to be changed from their original ways, into something completely different. You should have seen my face when I saw the Curriculum from the Citadel. We were nothing more than tools for them. I know that most of the people on this city are nothing more than that, but you know that you can’t condemn the bright ones for the dull knifes in the drawer.”</i> then she looks at you from her side. <i>“Your uncle was someone that was moved by her genitals more than anything. You should have seen the times that he tried to coerce me into fucking him. Oh dear, he thought that I was like the other ladies, but I managed to bore him to death. And there it is one of its relatives, trying to get the good side of me. But I’m not gonna let that an unknown brat tells me what to do just because it has a pinch of blood from someone that was better of dead than alive”</i>\n\nAfter that, she stands from the chair’s arm. You can see that her body is well-endowed. <i>“And with that being said, I would prefer to meet you somewhere else. Next time we will go to the gardens of the university. I’m getting tired of talking here with someone that doesn’t even know the installations properly.”</i> she says, as you tell her that it’s a great idea but that you have some matters to attend before that. You thank her for her time as you excuse yourself from the place. This will be harder than you thought at first.";

You sit and tell her that you finalized the conversation with the scholar that she assigned. She nodded and placed the small mirror in the desk, just before taking a good look at you.\n\nShe looks pleased at your performance, or so it seems. <i>“Very well, you’ve earned it fair and straight. I’m quite surprised that you took your time to do the proper protocol on the university. That wasn’t something that your so-called uncle used to do. Usually, sending him to do anything that could be remotely called work was enough to get him off my back”</i> she says with a condescending tone.

But you have the blood of your uncle after all, its just a matter of time before you screw it up and become just like him.”</i> and after saying that, she sighs and stands from the chair, walking across the room without looking at you directly. You ask her what your uncle did to her and the university to get so much animosity on her behalf.\n\nShe crossed her arms with a hint of disgust, probably remembering some things about your uncle. Or at least that’s the usual reason of why someone makes that face when they are close to you <i>“Your uncle was instructed by the Citadel, that the education had to be changed from their original ways, into something completely different. When I saw the Curriculum from the Citadel, I feel that they wanted to use us more for manpower than the original focus of the university, that its something more focused on increasing a broad set of skills, rather than just becoming the toolbox of the Citadel.”</i> then she looks at you. <i>“But I didn’t allowed him to coerce me, even when he tried to do it from time to time. I’ve heard the rumors, you’re not from the Citadel and you’re off their influence. But I’m not gonna let that an unknown brat tells me what to do just because it has a pinch of blood from someone that was better of dead than alive”</i>\n\nAfter that, you turns around and places her back against the wall.

You’re the leader of this city, and you’ll make sure that she understands that at the end of this interactions with her. You have other matters to attend and you can’t keep playing her games forever.

You greet her formally as she stands from the bench. <i>“Walk with me, “my liege”.”</i> she says, as she starts walking through the roads of the garden, as you follow her for now. <i>“I’ve heard what you did with Virgil. You decided to take him off my grasp and behind my back. You didn’t even told me about it. He’s got a title and everything! And talk about squashing my authority in the university.”</i> She says with an acid tone. <i>“Good to know that I knew that it is in the blood”</i> You frown with her behavior, you just thought that she was being an asshole with that whole scheme with Virgil. Yeah, he has a place to sleep and work, but that was almost servitude.\n\n <i>“Look, I know why you’re here. I may be old, but I can see things clearly.”</i> She stops walking for a second, before shaking her head and restarting her walk again. <i>“And I’ll to whatever is need for you to get out of here as fast as possible and leave me alone without causing me more problems.”</i> Well, that sure saves you a lot of negotiation.\n\nYou can see that there are several students doing all kinds of things in those gardens. From training her speeches asz others debate among several hot topics. And of course you can hear a couple of moanings and the scent of arousal in the air from time to time, at least they were training their skills in stealth for all you can think of. <i>“This university holds most of the noble sons and daughters of Aurorum. And even there are some that have a tutor instead, usually its someone that is connected to this place one way or the other. And I know that you’re visiting the important places to see that “things gets done correctly”, to win your legitimacy with the support from everyone involved in the important things of the city.”</i> She is smart enough to see the political implications, but if you could be honest, it’s not alchemy to think that the new liege would require to do that in the first place, so you’ll give her a B- for her efforts.\n\n<i>“But if I want to make sure that you understand the needs of the university, I need to make sure that you understand the requirements of the place. And in exchange for my support, I would like that you assist to some classes and  workshops as an audit and perhaps talk with be about the things you found. With that, I would be sure that the Liege would be informed. That would separate you quite a lot from your predecessor. You would enter into a place of knowledge and get out of it knowing a little bit more. It seems that you require that a lot.”</i> She sure enjoys fooling around with your lack of education.\n\nAssisting at the university. At first you can remember how you were being home-schooled by your mother, then it was the Guardian that she prepared for you. You tell her that its the first time that you would set a foot in a classroom. She smiles a bit. <i>“It’s never late to attend school, even if its temporary. So… do you agree to my terms or we should start hostilities just like the old days?.”</i> You think that she has something stuck up her ass, but you take it as an opportunity to understand more of the place and to have an excuse to talk with Celia and see if you can remove it from inside her. You accept her terms, something that pleases her. <i>“Then it’s settled. You’ll start tomorrow. I’ll look forward to see how this sorts out, “my liege”. ”</i> And with that, you tell her that you must get ready for attending that, so you retire from the place, leaving her walking through the trees as you retire from there.";

She knows that your knowledge about the university is limited and she doesn’t leave a chance to remind you of that. But after a while of trying to understand the university, you start to answer back. Every time you had the chance, you used some snarky remarks about how old she is, as you can remember that she said that she is old. You’re not sure how much, but when you see that it somehow bothers her, you don’t let the subject down. After a while, you can see that every subject about the administration of the university becomes an opportunity to show the other how good they were about undermining the other in the best way.\n\nYou can see that despite being the bitchy teacher that she is, her structure of the university seems to be quite capable of sustaining itself. You know that you’ll regret it later, but you say that she is good at adapting the university to these new times. <i>“Of fucking course! It has been taking a while, but since most of the students are too busy trying to get into each others holes, let alone in their pants, its hard to make them focus enough to force some knowledge in their skulls, so we had to improvise. The sex class was a success at first, but after there wasn’t a teacher that was able to deal with the students, we decided that he had to do something on a larger scale”</i> As she mentions the sex class, you can see that her breathing gets heavier while her eyes fog as she is probably remembering something.\n\n<i>“We allowed the students to sate their urges inside their bedrooms, as long as they keep it in their dormitories and no one gets bothered by it.”</i> She smiles at that remark. <i>“But I’ve been thinking about something for a while, and maybe your lack of focus on the university matters can help me on this one.”</i> She takes out a couple of papers that are waiting for her signal from what you can see. <i>“The traditional rules aren’t fit for this kind of city and I have two options.”</i> She points at one of the papers that seems to be more full of text. <i>“By having looser rules that takes into account the corrupt states of the students, I can save me a lot of time and effort. They are already corrupt and I can rest assured that they’ll keep themselves in that way. They may even shape their studies with new ways of learning and as long as they learn something new in these events, we are good to go. We require less staff enforcing the laws and everyone’s happy”</i> Then she points at the other paper, which seems to be lighter than the other. <i>“This one removes most of the rules. This one is what is happening right now after all, as we don’t have enough staff to enforce the rules that we already have. The staff will be free to work on other parts of the university and we’ll have a more uniform mindset of students, if you get my drift.”</i> After that, she thinks for a moment then takes a good look at you. <i>“What do you think?

All of the things that both of you see at the university go smoothly, even though she has to bite her tongue more than you thought it would be humanly possible without bleeding to death.\n\nYou think that her strict behavior is quite beneficial for the university, as it seems that its keeping itself quite stable in their rules and the way they enforce it.

She takes out a couple of papers that are waiting for her signal from what you can see. <i>“The students have been protesting against the unfair laws that we’ve been enforcing on the last weeks. Even thought we have been more relaxed on some of the laws, we’ve been more strict on some others to compensate. I think that’s a fair trade”</i> She points at one of the papers that seems to be more full of text. <i>“They have been sending letter after letter with their own set of rules. And oh boy, most of them are quite scandalous, at least to the traditional standards.”</i> She sighs as she takes out the papers and gives them a look for one second, before leaving them on their original place. <i>“I dunno what to do with them, as they are more than a wild bunch of students, they are almost a parade of them trying to get to me to concede.

Today is a slow day on anything that has to do with the administration of the university. So, we must find something else to do.”</i> She says, as you can see that her skin is tender and soft from the look of it. You take the opportunity and ask about her. <i>“Me? Of course, what do you want to know about me? Anything about me is interesting.”</i> She says as she sits on the desk and crosses her legs.\n\nYou ask her who she is, if she is from Aurorum, anything about her. You have been wondering those things about her but you never give them a good thought and now that both of you have some tine, you want to know.  <i>“I’m not from here, as you can imagine. I’m from Wissenham, one of the closest cities to the Citadel. Something happened and my mother and me moved from the city. Aurorum was the best choice for both of us. A place where the philosofy and the education is something quite important, of course that I got hooked the first time that I heard about the place. At first it was amazing, but after the plague everything went south very fast, but at least we recovered our autonomy. Since a lot of people has lost all their inhibitions, there is always something new around the place or people to meet and enjoy in all ways.”</i> She looks quite interested in the new ways of the city. <i>“I’ve learned the ropes from the philosophers and the other teachers that I had at the time. The citadel had its hands full from the problems of the other cities, to come and reclaim some far and small town quite close to the shore. During that time I meet my actual husband, he’s a philosopher from the city, so we accorded a marriage so I could get some way to get into the university as she gained a wife. He’s… nice and comfy. "+ line1 +"\"</i> She says as she coughs a bit, adjusting her skirt, probably moving everything with it. <i>“But I kept floating this ship even through the murky waters of the Plague, if I can brag about it. That’s why I’m the Dean. No one else had the balls to push this place afloat. I dare to say that I made a goddamn job about that”</i> And with other places almost in shambles, the fact that the university is up and going, even in a sorry state is truly something surprising. But you can see that the classes are crammed with students and the classrooms can be barely be called like that, so you know that the place requires a lot of help.\n\nAfter that, her secretary enters the office with a folder that she places on top of the desk. By the look of her, you can see that she is being careful with the Dean. You can see that Celia barely notices that she is there while she keeps talking about her past and the past events of the university. After the secretary finally leaves the place, Celia turns and takes the folder. <i>“Oh, right. I remember telling her that she should bring this up in case that you arrive. Its something that I would require your undivided attention, my liege. Its about the teachers of the university”</i> And after that, she points at the paper that she has in her hands.\n\n<i>“After deciding about the rules inside the university, it was just a matter of time before the teachers of the different classes would come and bitch about it. I dealt with them with utmost efficiency as you can imagine, but that won’t help on the long run. I can reach an agreement with them, as they are quite knowledgeable and reliable, but I’m not sure if I should do it. They are after all, guided by the old laws of the university.”</i> Then she looks at you carefully and smiles maliciously. <i>“Maybe its a good opportunity to make some changes on the faculty. Maybe new classes with new teachers. All the things that the Citadel fought to suppress after they conquered us and even some new ones. But I would like to have the good side of the authority with me on this. So… what do you reccomend?”</i> After that, you can only think that they have both good points. On one side there are the reliable teachers from an old age, that maybe can make it return on the next generation. On the other side there are the rebels of the Citadel, bringing up a new kind of city with them.";

So you open the door slightly, only to see what its happening inside. There was Celia, sitting in front of the desk, but you can see that there is a male student too. She is holding his cock in her hand, stroking it with haste as she holds a vial in her other hand. <i>“Come on, cum already…”</i> She says, as her naked chest shows and presses against the balls of the lucky student. When she finally makes him cum, she starts collecting his spunk in the vial as it soaks her ample breasts. "+ line1 +" When she finishes collecting the viscous fluid, she corks it and tells him to get dressed. You move out before they notice you.\n\nYou think that’s what Virgil meant about the information that he gave you. Perhaps she uses some kind of alchemy to help her to look that young. This could be transformed into a scandal. You’re sure that you can use this kind of thing to blackmail her into becoming something more of your liking. Perhaps she can become someone more open with her ways of recollecting her ingredients. On the other hand, maybe she only requires to let off some steam, as there is no need for her to use that. She only needs to get fucked properly and she must not let herself feel stopped because of her husband. Decisions, decisions.\n\nYou know that its probably her way of releasing steam, but you know that she is holding back the thought of taking steps in different directions. You think that it will be harder for you to get some help from her to restore the city to its former glory if she let herself go to her impulses. But you know also that if she becomes more addicted to the feeling of sexual fluids on her skin, she will be more compliant with your petitions. Any way, you have to intervene before this goes out of hand for your plans, so you search for the student that you saw that day and force him to help you with this, its not that hard with your connections and some assertiveness. With that thought in mind and the proof required to back it up, you arrive at her office some time later, as she greets you as always. \n\n<i>“Well, hello there, liege. So you came here to decide something else over the university?”</i> But you raise one hand into the air so she cuts the greeting, you tell her that you saw what she was doing with one of the students the other day. She is surprised from your remark. <i>“Y-You do?”</i> You nod, as you tell her that you got the students to prove that. And with that, you tell her that she could be in very serious trouble if the parents of these noble students know about these kind of treatment to their students. They would worry that you could be infected with the plague. That would be her career’s downfall. She gulps and nods just before you ask her why she is doing that. <i>“Well, about that…”</i> \n\nShe sighs and takes out a small bottle from one of her drawers. <i>“Its because of this.”</i> You get close to the bottle, but you can see that she is covering it quite carefully. <i>“This ointment is the reason why I look so young and lively. Its an old alchemical recipe, that was hard to come by before the plague. Why? Because the key ingredient for this is the sexual fluids of young and lively people.”</i> You can see that she is wary of your reaction. By the look of her face, she is trying to bare herself to you, probably to gain your mercy. <i>“But now with the plague, its easier for me to get the ingredients. So…”</i> She takes a good look at your face, trying to keep her dignity without much success. <i>“If you’re here and you haven’t sold me to others, its because you want something, right?”</i> \n\nAnd with that, you know that she will follow your instructions for the time being.

You ask her if she has been teaching before her actual post of Dean, and she look at you as if the very question insulted her. <i>“Of course! Its pivotal to know the job of learning before applying to the position of Dean. I am a great teacher, but its a hard job, especially after the Plague.

You tell her that there are some things that could be improved for sure. But you’re quite curious, as she seems to know a lot of the university.

After that, a couple of students enter the classroom, as Celia tries to cover her ample breasts from them. <i>“What does this mean?”</i> She turns to see you, but one of the students starts talking. <i>“We’ve been waiting a long time for this occasion, Miss Celia”</i> He says, as he approaches her from behind and gropes her breasts. <i>“I’ve seen how you see us, Dean.”</i> To which she shakes her head. <i>“No, I can’t!”</i> she says, but you got closer to her and rub her pussy with one of your hands, as you can feel that she is wet already. You tell her that this is what she wants, that you know deep inside her there is this part that enjoys being the lust recipent of a lot of lusty people.  \n\nThe other students and you continue teasing her body, playing with her nipples, pinching her ass and teasing her pussy. Her cries of discomfort quickly become gasps and small moans.  <i>“Oh dear, you’re so strong, so passionate…”</i> "+ line2 +""+ line3 +"\n\nAs you work her front, the students enjoy her ass. One of them rubs his penis against her asshole, penetrating her with joy as she muffles a moan in your flesh. The other student starts licking the Dean’s pussy"+ line4 +" with impatience. The whole gangbang goes on by what seems to be hours, until you can’t hold it anymore and pat the shoulders of the other students. Both of them leave her at the edge of orgasm and stand in front of her, cumming at the same time and filling her whole body with your fluids. Her blouse half-torn is soaked in your cum, as her breasts and face is sporting the juices of the other two students. You can see her face turning into one of delight "+ line5 +" while her whole body trembles from the sensations that the three of you did.\n\nAfter that, you dismiss the students and see the state of the Dean. You can see how she is lifting her torso from the ground. <i>“That was… amazing. I haven’t felt this rush since forever!”</i> She takes a good look at you. <i>“You were right… I had the power but I never used it properly.”</i> She stands from the ground, her body dripping the strong-scented fluids of everyone involved. <i>“Thanks for opening my eyes to this”</i> \n\nShe squeezes her clothes a bit before closing it once more. <i>“If you’ll excuse me… I have to send someone to clean this mess.”</i> she says, before leaving the classroom.
