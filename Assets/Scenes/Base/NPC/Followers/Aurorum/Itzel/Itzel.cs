			Board.text = "After dealing with Lucina, you finally feel free to focus again on your rise to power, and following Abbadon’s advice, you decide to go to where the former church was. When you finally arrive to the place you are surprised to find nothing but ruins. You walk through them, motivated mostly by curiosity, and you get scared when a sneaky woman surprises you from behind. <i>“Hi " + mcpronoun + "! Are you looking for something here?… Although it is not like there is much left to look at…”</i> You turn around and find a petite woman looking at you with a smile on her face. Her brown skin and slight accent it’s evidence that she is a foreigner, something odd since almost no one travels to this city. You shake your head: No, you are not looking for something, but someone, and you ask her if she is the one that Abbadon mentioned. \n\n<i>“Oh Abbadon has heard about me? That’s amazing! I… I recently arrived to the city, and haven’t met anyone important yet, but people look at me with… Curiosity.</i> She seems somewhat weirded out by the behavior of the people, but that’s normal, after a couple of years of almost complete isolation, anyone who is brave enough to come to this shithole is indeed a curiosity.   \n\nYou ask her if she knows who you are, and she stares at you for a a couple of seconds, trying to recognize you or figure out whom you are.<i>“I apologize, but I don’t think we have met before…”</i> You smile and tell her that that’s fine, you turn around to your castle and point it with your finger, telling her that that’s your home. She doesn’t react immediately, unsure if she is understanding what you actually meant, but when it becomes obvious, her face becomes red and she performs a low bow, apologizing. <i>“I am sorry " + mcpronoun + "! I wasn’t aware of that! People around here deceived me and told me that there was no one in charge of the city! If I had knew, I would had presented myself at your doorstep!”</i> You tell her that you yourself are new around too, and that people is… Skeptical about you, but you pretend to change that soon. \n\n<i>“I-I see… Well my " + mcpronoun + ", let me present myself and my purpose in your city then. My name is Itzel, your humble missionary, and I have been sent from our holy church of our Goddess and savior Valeris, the giver of life, to rebuild the spiritual community in this city. I… Am not sure how knowledgeable you are about the scriptures, since I am aware that we started to preach the word of our Goddess here only after the war… And therefore my secondary mission is to teach about to those who want to know. Would… Y-you like to listen about it?”</i>\n\nShe looks nervous about asking you. You could just ignore her religious teachings, but you know whatever you like it or not, a church will be rebuilt in the city sooner than later, and having a say of what is established it’s critical for your quest for power. Of course, you could just be arbitrary about it, but who knows what will be the result of that.\n\n";

You know, I can’t rest very well until this issue is settled, since preaching on the streets is really tiring, so I can’t be that useful to you until this is done, but once it is, we can totally talk about other matters and how we can work together improving the city!”</i> Itzel, displaying her usual energy and nonstop chat, at least seems excited about what’s next, which is a good change around the city for once. \n\nYou explain her that you have decided to build the church to…";

			Board.text = "You decide to visit Itzel tonight, and although you wonder if its fine to just crash her place without warning, you are pretty much already there. From a block away you can see the smoke going out through the fireplace, and when you arrive to the front, you give a peek through the window, where you can see her struggling in the kitchen. You hear scream something, and while you can’t understand what she said, you are certain that it was something profane. \n\nDeciding not to rush, you wait a couple of minutes outside until you believe things have calmed down before knocking the door. When you do, she opens the door showing you her happy, usual face, as if nothing had happened yet. <i>“Greetings! Glad to see you again, I was wondering when would you come again… Please, come in! I was just… Cooking… Well, or trying to do so.”</i> you tell her that if its not a good moment, you can come another day, but she takes your hand and pulls you inside before closing the door. <i>“It’s fine just take a seat, it was nothing serious… you can only learn by screwing things up right? I have some well done porridge if you want… Although you are probably used to fancy food up there in the castle, a humble meal would get you closer to our Goddess.”</i> \n\nYou accept some even though you are not particularly excited for the food, but that’s probably the point of the whole thing. She nods her head and goes back to the kitchen to serve a bowl for each of you. \n\nOnce she is back, she sits at your side again in the coach. Before you taste it she stops you. <i>“Shouldn’t we pray and thank the Gods for our meal?”</i> Whatever you are interested or not, there is no scape from this, and you just ask her to lead. It takes her a couple of minutes to thank several Gods and saints that you have never heard of before she is finished. <i>“That’s all, lets proceed”</i> You gladly do so, tasting the porridge. She wasn’t right, you had almost forgotten the flavor of tasteless food that was common during your youth, making you feel some nostalgia about your past. <i>“So how it is?”</i> You tell her that she was right about the humbling experience. <i>“Glad to hear that, although I sense that this is not the first time that you taste something like this… I’ve seen rich people before trying for the first time food that doesn't cost what a poor man earns in a year and definitely their reactions were different.”</i> \n\nYou tell her that she is right,that actually you’ve been living in the forest since you were a child, because of the assassination of your father by the late lord, who was your uncle. <i>“O-oh… I am sorry, I didn’t knew about it… People here doesn’t want or can talk much about you, so I apologize for being so insensitive.”</i> You say that she shouldn’t worry much about it, you barely remember anything about that, or the city, although you are glad that your mother returned recently. <i>“Seriously?! That sounds great! That must be the wish of the Gods for you to have that luck!”</i> You aren’t so sure about that, considering the situation of your mother, but probably you should leave that for another day.\n\nTo change the topic you ask about her, and what’s her story. <i>“About me? Where to start… I am from the Viceroyalty of Tzime, a capital city in the middle of the jungle. The place is like a veeery big fortress, without doubt the second largest after the citadel. That reign was fighting for the control of the island against the citadel, but as you may guess, they ultimately lost the war. In any case, I am an orphan, and I’ve lived with the church since I can remember. They taught me everything I know, and shortly before the plague I moved to the neighboring city, Ku-Jiang, where I served as an acolyte until not long ago.”</i> After these words, she pauses, as if know she had to remember and talk about bad memories. \n\n<i>“When the plague started, well… Those were very confusing times, but long story short, pretty much every city got isolated after it, with little to not trade, and there was no veracity in any news from another city since most people that actually travel end up corrupted themselves.”</i> You ask if that is the case with her <i>“W-what? N-no! Of course not! Do I look corrupted to you?”</i> You shrug, saying that you are no expert on the topic, she shakes her head and rejects your question, but you ask her if that’s not what a corrupt person would do. She sighs, frustrated <i>“I promise we can talk about that another day but… Let me finish my story tonight”</i> Fine, you apologize for interrupting her story. <i>“It’s fine. Where I was? Ah right… Yes, I those were some harsh times, we lost a lot of people during those days to the plague, but we kept our hopes high and I kept learning so I could become a priestess someday. I guess I could talk about so many anecdotes about those times, but this is the substance of it. A couple of months before I came we had news that the church in this place was destroyed and the priest ran disappeared, and I offered myself volunteer to come here and preach the word, since the church was reluctant to send some by their own. And… That’s actually how I became a priestess too, since they ordained me just a couple of weeks before my departure.”</i> \n\nIt is impossible for you to hide your surprise and skepticism about this. She gives you a not-so-serious angry face in reaction <i>“I know what you may be thinking, but although my title is new, remember that I’ve been with the church since I was a child, I know everything that there is to know about religious matters.”</i> You tell her that that’s true, but managing a church is more than theology: Is politics, is charisma, is to be able to take hard choices. She is about to answer, but stops before it’s too late. After a pause, she continues <i>“You may be right… I lack that experience, and… Yeah, remember I said earlier? You screw up while learning?… But I don't want to disappoint you nor the city, so… Would you help me to do what is right, right?”</i> You smile, of course you will, in the end, her failure would harm you too. <i>“I know… But you should do right just for the sake of it right? But I guess it doesn’t matter, so long we end up helping the city.”</i> That’s what matters.\n\nEven though you are enjoying the night, you can see that she is pretty tired, about to fall asleep, so you decide to wrap up for the day. <i>“Thanks for coming my Liege, I hope you come more often to have another pleasant night like this, my door is always open so, just come whenever you want.”</i> You appreciate her gesture and, before leaving, she jumps at you and gives you a small kiss in the cheek, and you pat her head before leaving. \n";

As a matter of fact, Itzel has told you that she will take care of overseeing this rebirth of the religion, and therefore she may not be the priest in charge of the cathedral so she can focus on these matters. \n\nYou are looking at one of the statues when Itzel sneaks up to you. \n\n<i>“Hey, great job right? I am almost in awe of how much we can do in so little… Certainly this is a omen for our future.”</i> You agree, and ask if everything is ready for you to come out and start the ceremony. <i>“Yes, I believe so, do you have an speech ready?”</i> You tell her that she has nothing to worry about, that you got this. She smiles, but you can sense that she is nervous. <i>“I hope everything goes right, from now on I am truly in charge, these times of tribulations are finally about to end.”</i> You nod, and reassure her that everything is going to be fine before walking towards the entrance. \n\nWhen you step outside, you are welcomed by the cheers of the multitude. It seems like half the city came to this event, even though you didn’t promoted it as aggressively as you could. You walk to the podium and stand tall before commencing your speech, but the question is: Should it be a generic speech about the future, or maybe you will use the opportunity to talk about Itzel and her efforts?

In short, the whole city is helping, and it’s a great feeling and a great start, I am certain that the Gods will be pleased with the actions of the city.”</i> It is great to hear that the Gods will bless the city, is just what it needs really, and whatever you believe it or not, the superstitious population will, and will thank you for bringing change, even though it would had happen even without your help. Not like they need to know that.\n\nYou change to a more casual topic now, asking her about her current live, or what he used to do in Ku-Jiang. <i>“You mean, with my free time?… Well, I’ve never really had that much free time, nor I am the kind of girl that goes wild you know, so usually reading or helping around: Cleaning, farming, things like that”</i> Yeah, you can imagine her being kinda boring like that, although you also believe that if she tried, or if she wanted to be wild, she probably would be someone fun to have around. You of course omit your opinion, but ask her if once the church is done, she would like to enjoy the city and herself more. She laughs, though not in an offensive manner  <i>“I am glad that you care about me, and that’s why I am sure you will be a great leader for this city. Since you insist, I am willing to try to have some fun, but please feel free to plan something since obviously I am not great at these kind of things.”</i> You nod and tell her that she doesn’t have to worry, you will take care of it.  \n\nOnce the dinner is over, and is getting late, you decide to go back to your castle. <i>“Thanks again for your visit, I am eager to see what you have in mind for the next time, take care!”</i> You say goodbye, while thinking what would be good for the next time.\n\n<b>Should you go to a fine restaurant with her, or have a walk through the cultural district?</b> ";

Disguised with rags and shit all over you, people will never think of you as a king, and you enter the booth without rising anyone’s eyebrows. \n\nOnce there, you greet Itzel first, and with a young feminine voice (which you selected because it will be easier for her to relate to you) you ask for her blessings and to hear your confession. She answers with her sweet voice <i>“Bless you, my child, welcome to our humble church, the house of "+ goddess +", open your soul, for I am not here to judge, but to forgive.”</i> You thank her, and you tell her that this is the first time doing this. <i>“Do not worry, this place is to find peace of the soul, no need to be nervous, just talk to me about what troubles your being, and the Goddesses will forgive you for what you have done.”</i> Before you start, you ask a little more about the religion, and although she says this is not the place to talk about it, and invites you to the mass, since there is no one else coming, she can indulge herself and starts to talk about it, explaining to you what is a sin, what is not, and the wide nature of the Goddess, that far from being perfect or all powerful, they have their own whims, flaws, but that ultimately they show the path to get over oneself.    \n\nYou thank her, and after telling her small sins, you ask for council. She offers to talk outside another day, but you tell her that you rather do it anonymously and through here, and without much effort she accepts.\n\nMumbling and whispering at first, you talk about how lately you had strange feelings inside you… As something that burns inside you. At first Itzel is reluctant, but when you tell her that you have no one else to ask about this says that she will do her best to help you. You go on, telling her how your nether parts get humid when you get a sight of a good looking man, or voluptuous and sexy woman. Itzel tries to say  that that’s natural, but her shy tone makes it obvious that she isn’t used to have this kind of talk. You attack by asking her if she goes through the same. <i>“I…”</i> she thinks about lying, but being in the house of the Goddesses, and while doing a sacred function, would make the act so worse that she would have a hard time forgiving herself, let alone any divinity. <i>“Yes… It happens to all of us… Is a natural feeling, nothing to be scared off…”</i> eager, you ask her if she knows how to deal with it. <i>“D-Deal with it? W-what you mean?…”</i> yeah, how to make the feeling go away, so you can regain focus. <i>“Er… I D-…”</i> she pauses, thinking her words wisely. <i>“I t-think the Goddess Servilia h-has wonderful lessons about it… M-maybe I can give you a book of her…”</i> saddly, you tell her, you, as most people in the city, don’t know how to read. <i>“I-Is that so… F-Fine, I’ll tell you…”</i>. \n\nYou finally push her into talking about masturbation, how is done, and how she does it. You ask if she does everything that she says to you <i>“Y-Yes… Sometimes… I m-mean is natural.”</i> when you are about to go further, someone knocks the door. <i>“Ah… I am sorry, but our time is over, other people need my service now, hope this helps you…”</i> Before you leave, you ask if you can come in another time. There is an awkward pause, clearly she doesn’t enjoys yet the topic, but she doesn’t want the reputation of rude, or that she is unwilling to help, and at the end with a gentle tone tells you that everyone is always welcome to come back ask for forgiveness. Vague, but at least she won’t refuse. \n\nA couple of days later Itzel visits you at your castle. <i>“My Liege I need to ask your something…”</i> For a second, you feel like a punch in your stomach, did she found out? But thankfully, she continues with better news <i>“The… Other day I had to deal with this person at the confessional. I can’t go into details, of course, but the topics at hand were… Complicated and personal, I think I did helped the person, but do you think I should be more strict and evasive in the future?”</i> You shake your head, of course not, the people going to her for help is what both of you were looking since from the start, and is the only way to earn the confidence of the people <i>“Yeah… That’s true, I just wanted to hear it from you, I guess I felt kinda awkward, but there is nothing wrong nor bad about it, right?”</i> You nod and you tell her that you are proud of her, and that she should keep going through that path, or even further if it is in her ability. <i>“F-Further?”</i> Yeah, is she doing everything she can to actually help people, or not? <i>“I… I think so? But I don’t know, you may be right… Fine, I’ll take my leave now, but thanks for your advice, it makes me feel better about this.”</i> With this conversation, you know both what to do next, and that she will fall for it, which is perfect.

She gives you a very short smile, and then closes her eyes, seemingly tired. <i>“I couldn’t sleep well last night, my mind was going on and on about this issue.”</i> You can see that, but you told her that she doesn’t have to worry about it, it’s not an impossible task. <i>“I know, that’s not what worries me, is just the fact itself… What if I had harm someone because of it?”</i> You smile, she is too good for her own sake.\n\nItzel slowly sits down and yawns. <i>“I’m ready, let’s get started.”</i> you move and sit at her side. Very well, tonight, you say,it’s important first we make clear why this is important, not just for herself, but for the whole city. <i>“But I Already k-”</i> You stop her, yes she <i>knows</i> but she never had so much responsibility, and you, as someone who has been dealing with this for a while know how difficult it is, and how critical is to have people around that know at least something about it. \n\nShe stays quiet and nods, and you proceed to talk about how now she will face hard choices, choices that will change and shape the city, the life of it’s citizens, and the overall success or failure of the state. There is little room for mistake in these harsh times where civilizations are hang by a thread. She seems overwhelmed by your words, but you relax your tone a little and tell her that this is why she needs to trust you and others in your administration too, working together but also vigilant of failure. \n\nThe last topic of the night is about how she is responsible for others too, specially those under her command and who hear her very advice and guide, but also that it is negligent to see others plotting and behaving wrongly and letting them go. \n\n<i>“But… I am not good at scolding people!”</i> You answer that that’s something that the both of us will work together on the following days. And not just <i>scolding</i>, but punishing appropriately. <i>“P-punishing?… That sounds to harsh…”</i> Yes, but as harsh as these times. \n\nShe nods, and although you want to continue, she is falling asleep at this point, and you take her to her bed before going back home. \n";

You expect that she probably had the experience of something like this in Ku-Jiang, but nonetheless you want to present what your city and its culture has to offer, and maybe motivate her to become more involved with the community, beyond religious matters.  \n\nYou go to her house in the afternoon and you find her waiting for you at her doorstep. <i>“Just in time, good! So what’s the plan?”</i> You just tell her to follow you and have fun. <i>“Kinda mysterious eh? Well, I trust you my Liege.”</i> With that settled, you walk towards the cultural district. \n\nWhile walking towards there, she starts to pay more attention to the city that surrounds her <i>“You know, I barely had any time to get to know this city, I would like to have the chance to at least visit some of these stores and places, get to know the people who run the city from the streets you know? There is where you can find a lot of good stories and anecdotes.”</i> You ask her how Aurorum compares to the other cities. <i>“It’s not as big as Ku-Jiang or Tzime, but this city has its own charm… The people is, I don’t know, less selfish? More willing to help and support each other?… And yeah, you may think I am exaggerating, but on the other cities everyone is on their own all the time.”</i> You certainly hope to find out by yourself soon enough, when you are done with this city. <i>“Yeah, going that far away is not an option when you have to rule and fix the struggles of the population.”</i>\n\nOnce you arrive, you are glad to see that the street is bursting with activity, and Itzel runs away from you to see the different people who is there entertaining the crowd: Jugglers, clowns, people performing weird stuff, cute animals and musicians. You can see her jumping from place to place, looking at them and thanking them for their effort. She even comes back and asks you for coins so she can give it to them, and since you only have gold with you (who would you use copper or silver coins anyway?), pretty much every tip she gives is a small fortune for them, so you can see how the mood, and the effort of everyone to try to impress her, augments. \n\nYou do your best to keep her pace, but she is way too energetic for you. Once you have walked half a mile, which is not even half of the long pedestrian street, she slows down and comes back to you.  \n\n<i>“Ow sorry, I got a little to excited, let’s sit down for a minute.”</i> Once seated, you have her hand at your reach, should you try to hold it? Doing so would mean you would like to have <i>something</i> with her in the future, which means some scenes will involve sex with her. ";

If she did things would be different, she would understand that corruption doesn’t make you a bad or a good person, but just liberates you from the unnatural social norms that try to control our lives. \n\nYou know there is nuance, that too much corruption and society will crumble and disappear, but none of it leads to no freedom and slavery.

Should I prepare only one, or do you need them in bulk?”</i> You ask her for what you think should suffice for your plans, and once the church starts to operate almost at its fullest you start to pay attention to Itzel schedule, to figure out when she goes into the confessional to hear people.\n\nFinally, you decide to pay your first visit.

You “confess” petty crimes and stuff, and she attentively hears you and answers to your questions, being forgiving and merciful as expected, and never doubting about your sincerity or realizing it was you. \n\nYou leave that day without doing much progress, but with confidence that you can move forward with your plans.

At first everything goes smooth and normal, and of course Itzel pretends as if she doesn’t knows you or remembers the last time at all, although that may be part of her routine nonetheless. \n\nBefore you go on, you look outside.

You ask, because she said it was natural and something everyone does. <i>“Y-Yes but… Ah…”</i> internally, she is struggling between her modesty and what you told her the other day about going beyond the call of duty.\n\nFinally, you can hear her sighing, <i>“F-Fine, but only once… So pay close attention.”</i> She opens the small hole in the booth, you remember how the carpenters had to apologize for these “mistakes”, but you told Itzel that they could come handy if, in example, the person was mute and had to hand her a written confession or something. Not the best excuse, but at least she stopped caring about it shortly afterwards.  \n\n<i>“J-just… Look through the hole… I’ll start in a minute…”</i> You can see the totally ashamed red face of Itzel, who is trying to get in position for the show. She puts her feet on the bench where she is sitting, rises up her skirt, showing her cute pussy, who is already drenched in fluids. You give her a compliment, telling her how cute it is. <i>“T-T-Thanks…”</i> she barely manages to say, and slowly starts to move her hand down there. <i>“P-Please pay at-tention… I w-wont do this again!”</i> she repeats herself, and with trembling hands she starts to touch herself, first the clit, doing circles around it and very softly pinching it. <i>“T-this is the most important thing… Make s-sure to be nice with it… Ah!…”</i> she let’s go a loud mouth, and she instantly reacts by covering it with her other hand. <i>“S-Sorry… But… That happens if you a-are doing a good job…”</i> she proceeds by going down, starting to penetrate herself first with a single finger, but once there is a small pool of fluids underneath her she inserts a second one. <i>“B-Be careful while doing this… You don’t want to h-hurt yourself if it’s your first time…”</i>.\n\nAlthough you expected her to stop at this point, to your surprise she actually keeps going, and faster by the minute, until she is properly masturbating as if she was alone, but then, she suddenly stops. <i>“…Wait.”</i> You can see she looks outside, and when she is certain no one is around, she starts to get naked <i>“W-when you do this, you n-need to be naked…”</i> she goes back in position but this time she plays with her nipples. She is enjoying herself too much, and you feel glad that this is going better and faster than you expected. \n\nShe goes for five minutes until she is on the edge <i>“I-I am about to c-come! P-please look at me c-cumming!”</i> she arches her back and starts to have a very violent orgasm, wetting all the clothes that she left on the floor. When she is done, you can see a satisfied smile in her face, and it takes a minute or two to recover. <i>“S-see my child… This is how is done…”</i> You thank her and say that you will try this at home. <i>“Y-yes, you do that…”</i> before you leave, you ask if you can come back for further lessons. <i>“Ah… That’ll be fine…”</i>.\n\nWhen you leave the booth, you can see there are people surrounding it, it seems like the guards let these people enter shortly after she looked outside, and they heard most of it. At least they don't know who is at the other side of the booth, bur rumors will spread fast… \n\nDays after your adventure, Itzel goes to your castle and talks about the advice you gave her. <i>“You know my Liege, you were right, it <b>feels good</b> to do the right thing.”</i> You laugh at her cynicism, but just pretend you don't understand what she means. <i>“Let’s just say that now I will really do my best for the city without fear anymore.”</i> happy with your progress, the next step should be pretty easy to handle.";

Or should I stop?”</i> You shake your head even she isn’t able to see you and tell her that no, of course she shouldn’t stop, and urge her to keep going. <i>“Hehe… Very well, you will love this!… I hope.”</i> She whispers the last thing, still insecure about her skills. \n\nAlthough she talks a lot about teaching and what not, she is actually very clumsy, and if you have to guess, you’ll assume this is her first time doing this. You think she has probably read about things like that in books about Servilia or another horny Goddess, but she only has only learned the theory. Not like you mind, there is something special and unique about inexperienced hands, is just it will take longer for her to satisfy you.\n\nShe starts to increase her peace, pumping you harder, and she seems to try to complement her awkward job by blowing thetip of your head, a nice fresh sensation that makes the experience more complete.  <i>“Are you enjoying this?…”</i> She asks with a dubious mouth, and you encourage her, saying that this is very good. <i>“Ah thanks!… I… Wish I had more experience… But I will learn. Can I ask you a favour? Please, just tell me when you are ready to release.”</i> You tell her that she has nothing to worry about, and she becomes more eager. \n\nThe hairjob goes for a while, but finally, you are on your edge. You tell her as promised, and you can hear her nervous answer. <i>“Ah… Please wait a second, I need to make sure you don’t taint this place!”</i> You do the best to hold up and you can feel how she is doing something with her hair. You can feel your whole tip is surrounded by the smooth texture, and finally, she is ready for you. <i>“Ah… I will go hard, make sure to shoot every load until you are satisfied!”</i> Between her hands, and your short hip movement, you cum in no time. You shoot load after load, feeling not just great physical pleasure, but at the same time you feel like your action is changing your soul and hers at the same time, a sensation that has no physical equivalent.\n\nWhen you don’t have a single drop of cum in your body, you wonder if she really was able to kept the other place clean. She hasn’t said a word since you were done, but she let your cock free, which allows you to kneel down and see through the hole. The vision is pretty great, seems like she was masturbating herself too and came at the same time than you did, and she is now on the ground, smeared on her fluids, while her hair is totally drenched on your seed. Some of it dripped down to her face and chest, but overall, at least she managed to kept the place clean. You can see she has her eyes open, but you are not sure if she is conscious, since she doesn’t seem to react.\n\nAfter a couple of minutes calling her she finally reacts. <i>“Ah… Sorry… I was in ecstasy… I never felt something like this before…”</i> She struggles to stand up and sit down on the bench. <i>“I… Think I need to go to my home and rest, but you should go first, thats the norm…”</i> You see how a big drop of cum goes through her cheek close to her mouth, and almost as a reflex you can see how she tastes it with her tongue. <i>“Oh my Goddesss… This tastes so good… Why no one told me before?!”</i> You can see how she starts to lick up everything thats on her skin, but sadly she knows most of it is wasted. You are weirded out by her reaction, but then you finally remember a side note of the alchemist about the voice changing potion, and how it could have some side effects. One of the, to make your cum kinda addictive. Oops, well, not like this is bad or anything, but just unexpected.\n\nWhen you are about to go Itzel stops you <i>“Hey… Come back soon, okay? I… Want to know that you are all right. Yeah, because that is my job…”</i> You know that’s not the motive, but you agree, and she laughs of happiness while you leave. ";

Of course, We at the church are here to help, right?”</i> You ask what you should do. <i>“Just… let me check something.”</i> You can hear how she opens her door to see if there is people around again, and with the place almost empty, she decides to proceed. <i>“Fine, we can go, but this time we need to be quiet…”</i> she opens the glory hole <i>“Let’s get naked first.”</i> You see her stripping her clothes off sensually, letting go her long hair, showing her very thin and feminine body. She even turns around and bends over a little, showing her a cute butt hole. When she is done, she moves closer to the gloryhole, where you can see her cunt in detail. <i>“First I will repeat the last lesson, just in case you return to your old body… It’s important that you don’t touch yourself, just look.”</i>\n\nWithout adding more, she starts to masturbate standing, more eager than the last time, since right now she was already overflowing with excitement. In no time she has a couple of fingers inside, pinching her nipples with the other hand, and bitting her lower lip, trying to stop herself for moaning, although you enjoy the music of sex in that booth: The sound of her hand clashing with her wet nether parts, her heavy breathing, and when she pinches herself too hard her muffled moans. She has moved so close to the glory hole, that you could lick her if you wanted, but you don’t want to screw up the situation. \n\nShe goes for five minutes until she has her first orgasm. <i>“Ah!… Ah!… D-Don’t miss this part… Ah!…”</i> she begs to you while cumming, and you indulge yourself, enjoying how the little priestess shivers with pleasure until she is finally sitting on her knees in a pool of her own fluids. \n\n<i>“T-that was good… W-what you think?”</i> You are not sure of what to answer, so you just answer that good too. <i>“Ah… Ah… W-Well… Now let me h-help you… L-Let me open this window…”</i> She opens the bigger overture, a window big enough that you can just bend and let crotch area or ass totally exposed to either be fucked or licked without problems. <i>“Here we go, get closer.”</i> You don’t need her to say it twice, you immediately put your dripping cunt at the hole <i>“Oh wow… It’s pretty cute…”</i>. \n\nYou can feel her breath on your clit, she must be just inches away from it, inspecting it. By the sound, you know she licks her lips, but you feel her getting closer and closer, but stops at the end. <i>“No… That’s too much for today…”</i> You can feel the smooth sensation of her hand softly caressing your nether parts, its soft touch very delicate, and you ask her what is she exactly doing. <i>“I… Am going to show you how to properly take care of yourself… Or should I stop?”</i> You shake your head even she isn’t able to see you and tell her that no, of course she shouldn’t stop, and urge her to keep going. <i>“Hehe… Very well, you will love this!… I hope.”</i> She whispers the last thing, still insecure about her own skills. \n\nAlthough she talks a lot about teaching and what not, she is actually very clumsy, and if you have to guess, you’ll assume this is her first time doing this to someone else. You think she has probably read about things like that in books about Servilia or another horny Goddess, but doing things to yourself and to others is a slightly different matter. Not like you mind, there is something special and unique about inexperienced hands, is just it will take longer for her to satisfy you.\n\nWith one hand she starts to penetrate you with a single finger, while she uses the other to play with your clit. Slowly but steadily, she increase her peace, pumping you harder, while introducing a second finger in you. You encourage her, saying that this is very good. <i>“Ah thanks!… I… Wish I had more experience… But I will learn. Can I ask you a favour? Please, just tell me when you are ready to release.”</i> You tell her that she has nothing to worry about, and she becomes more eager. \n\nThe masturbation goes for a while, but finally, you are on your edge. You tell her as promised, and you can hear her nervous answer. <i>“Ah… Please wait a second, I need to make sure you don’t taint this place!”</i> You do the best to hold up and you can feel how she is debating what to do. After 20 seconds that feel like an eternity, finally, she is ready for you. <i>“Ah… I will go hard, make sure to shoot every load until you are satisfied!”</i> Between her hands, and your short hip movement, you start to cum in no time. When you orgasm start, you can feel the warmth sensation of her mouth around your pussy, drinking everything you need to let out. Load after load, you feel not just great physical pleasure, but at the same time you feel like your actions are changing your soul and hers at the same time, a sensation that has no physical equivalent.\n\nWhen you don’t have a single drop left in your body, you wonder if she really was able to kept the other place clean.

Still, the woman is unruly and really doesn’t care about anyones authority, which is great, since there would be no point on correcting someone who already behaves. When the guards are trying to get the woman ready for what’s next Itzel arrives. <i>“My Liege”</i> she bows to you <i>“I am eager and ready to start, what is the case to deal with?”</i> Although it took you some time, you like how she is more serious and respecting, maturing fast for her new job. \n\nThe unruly woman screams and kicks one of the guards while they are restraining her in the table, face down. The guard is about to hit her, but you command him to stop before he does so. The guard apologizes, and you ask them to leave. <i>“I guess this needs no explanation… Will you come with me?”</i> you shake your head, you will only be looking from the back, it is her time to shine. <i>“Very well I will not disappoint you”</i> She better doesn’t. \n\nShe goes down stairs while you enter and close the door behind you, but you stay over there, looking without interfering. \n\nWhen the woman sees who will be dealing with him, she starts to talk and beg to Itzel <i>“H-hey! You l-look like a sweet girl, right? Please tell those men to liberate me, I have done nothing wrong!”</i> Itzel doesn’t answer, instead she walks to a desk and takes the horse whip that you used the last time. She touches it, and hits her hands a couple of times. The woman, who cannot see her, starts to get nervous. <i>“W-whats going on? I-”</i> Itzel hits her without prior notice and the woman screams of surprise and pain. <i>“Ah! Why ar-”</i> she trie to say, but Itzel hits her again. During the next few minutes, even before Itzel mutters a word, she keeps hitting the woman each time she dares to speak, until she understands. \n\n<i>“It took you some time to understand… Are you some kind of masochist?”</i> asks Itzel <i>“No I-”</i> Itzel hits her again when she tries to answer <i>“It’s a rhetorical question… You know, the kind of question that you don’t need to answer.”</i> she walks to the other side of the table, where Itzel bends over and grabs the womans chin to inspect her face. <i>“You are pretty, but I guess that’s not the reason why you are here… Or maybe it is.”</i> The woman is frightened, but you can see that Itzel is also very nervous, but using all of her will power to appear tough. The woman just manages to shake her head. <i>“Very well, you shall speak, but only to tell the truth. If I sense the slightest doubt in your voice I will punish you, you understand?”</i> The woman nods. Once everything is settled, Itzel starts with the interrogation <i>“Let’s start… Why are you here?”</i> the woman sobs <i>“I don’t know! Ah!”</i> Itzel reacts instantly, punishing her as fast as she tries to deceive her.\n\nItzel keeps pressuring her over and over until the woman finally breaks. <i>“P-Please no more! I’ll talk! S-Stop!”</i> Itzel gives her a chance to talk, but starts to caress her body from the top to the bottom with the tip of her horse whip, just to keep her stressed. <i>“I confess! I’ve been seducing young men! Their strong bodies and hard dick are the only way I can feel satisfied!… I’m sorry! I didn’t intended to do wrong… I just… Wanted a good dick up in my old cunt…”</i> That’s what everyone says, well, the <i>I’m sorry part</i> at least, but Itzel, kind as she is, accepts this apologies and starts to pat the womans head and gives her a kiss in the forehead. <i>“It’s fine, it wasn’t that hard, right?”</i> asks with her usual kind tone, and the woman, still in fear, just nods. \n\nBut something is changing, you can see how the face of Itzel is turning red and shows and displays a subtle smile <i>“Accepting the truth is a good first step, but is not enough, now it is time to get your proper punishment.”</i> the woman, believing further torture is about to come, starts to beg, but Itzel ignores her pleas and goes to the table. After a minute, she finally decides to take a ribbed strap. She walks in front of the woman and to her surprise, Itzel starts to get naked, exposing her overflowing pussy, flat chest and cute ass. You are certain she is dying to just assault the woman’s mouth with her nether parts but she manages to control herself. She has some trouble wearing the strap, being this the first time, but to you this only adds to the charm of the scene. Once she has it on, the confidence of Itzel goes through the roof <i>“It is time to pay for your sins whore, but is up to you how harsh I will be. You have a minute to suck this before I destroy your ass, so make sure you get it as wet as possible.”</i> The woman, in shock, doesn’t move for like 5 seconds, but when she realizes that Itzel is serious about it she starts to suck it with a lot of diligence, not with pleasure or lust but just trying to be as effective as possible, once the minute is finished, Itzel removes the restrains of the woman so she can stand up and bend over the table. <i>“Make sure to spread wide whore, as you do with those young men”</i> she doesn’t just wide opens her legs, but also uses her hand to pull her cheeks apart so Itzel has easy access to her butt hole. \n\nShe doesn’t even warns her, she just starts fucking her hard. <i>“Repent while I punish you! Be loud and clear!”</i> The woman, between panting and panting, tries to do so. <i>“I repent of e-enjoying young dicks! I-I rep-pent of s-sucking som-meone… Ah!… Else in the morning the m-minute my husband goes… Ah!… way! F-filing my cunt with ot-ther’s man cum-m!”</i> You Can see how this excites her more and more, who increases her peace with each word the woman says. ";

Her slurping sounds echo the place, and you can see the woman confused about all of this. Itzel is diligent, and really puts her heart into making you hard as a mast as soon as possible. The very moment you are ready, she stops. <i>“Use a lace, remember this isn’t for us.”</i> you nod and get yourself ready for what’s next.\n\n<i>“She has said everything she had to say, so punish her filthy mouth with your tool.”</i> you agree and wait for Itzel to take her position back at the ass of the woman, once there, both of you start to use her.

It is clearly at another level than Itzel, and by her skill level it is easy to guess why they found her out, she has probably slept with dozens of young men at this point, and rumors of someone as good as her spread easily. \n\nBoth of you try to sync the rhythm, and although none of you are supposed to be enjoying this, anyone who hears what is going on would beg to differ. \n\nThe exercise is too much for Itzel, who is the first to be overwhelmed by an orgasm, and lies down on the woman’s back. <i>“I… I need a hand…”</i> she says to you, and you stop and move to her side to see what’s going on. <i>“We… Are not done yet… B-but I need your help…”</i> she slowly opens her legs and, as the woman did not so long ago, spreads her butt cheeks with her hands. <i>“Lets… Lets punish her together…”</i> Her inviting little butthole is too tempting to reject at this point, and your dick is already lubricated by that woman’s saliva, so you decide to go forward, but slow so you don't harm Itzel too much. When the tip is in, she shouts of pain, and to distract her you start to pinch her nipples. Your face is too close to hers, and you make eye contact with her. You can feel the tension, both of you wanting to let go all the religious lectures and just go wild. With every inch of your hot rod that enters her, your faces get closer and closer, stopping only an inch away o each other. \n\nShe knows she shouldn’t do it, and she knows she needs to be strong for the city, and when you are about to do it she suddenly moves her hips, the pleasure of her tight ass distracts you from your impure desires.\n\nItzel starts moving backwards and forward, penetrating the woman again and herself in the process. She moves your hands from her chest to her hips <i>“Use all your might! Make this woman regret her sins!”</i> You start to fuck Itzel with all your strength, to the point that you can see tears in her cheeks, but she begs you to continue. You keep going and going, until Itzel starts to moan of pleasure. It doesn't take long until she orgasms again, and again, but you need to stop once she is exhausted on the woman’s back. \n\nYou on the other hand stay there, inside Itzel, you dick so ready to explode that if you need the tightness of her ass along the lace to avoid cumming. Even with blue balls you feel delighted with the scenery, and the fact that two women are exhausted because of your might. \n\nItzel recovers some conscience after 5 minutes, and you finally can get your cock out of her ass too. You hold her and help her to remove the strap. Content, you tell her that she is ready to take care of the church. <i>“Am I?… That’s great news!”…</i> she says, excited but tired. You tell her that there is only one thing left to do, and she looks at you puzzled <i>“W-what is that? I don't remember anything else…”</i> that’s because she is tired, but is nothing hard, she only need to gets on her knees, look up, and open her mouth , she does without protest. <i>“Like this?”</i> exactly, you explain that she is about to be baptized by you, and to not waste anything. At this point, both of you need some release and play along, she starts to masturbate her still virgin pussy while you jerk off. It doesn’t take long until you are at the edge again, and with some ceremony you pronounce some religious babble while finally removing the lace of your dick. You shoot load after load, hitting her face, hair and naked chest. She doesn’t drink every load that hits her mouth, instead she is waiting until you are done cumming.\n\nAfter more than 10 loads you are finally spent, and Itzel is truly drenched on your seed, her mouth overflowing with it. She can’t talk, but with a very subtle bow she thanks you and the Goddess, doing some gargles with it. At the moment she drinks it she starts to cum too, expressing delight and pleasure that only a true devotee like herself can show <i>“Ah… Ah… Thank you…”</i>. But she doesn’t stands up yet, she starts to smear your cum all over, using it as shampoo for her hair, and as body cream. At the end, her whole body is covered with a very thin layer of cum, the true meaning of a cum bath you would say. \n\nWhen that’s done, both of you dress yourselves. Thankfully, the scarf covers most of her head, and she looks pretty normal. <i>“I… Think I shall be going, I need to rest. But thanks to your support, now I feel capable to do my functions as a priest appropriately,  if… You think I need another lesson, or a remainder, please come and visit me, you know… My door is always open to you.”</i> she bows and you bow back, being glad that this turned off so well.

You keep walking until you are in front of her, and you bend over until your face is inches away from hers, feeling her excited breath and her barely open mouth seems pretty inviting, but what’s the fun of just going forward? You ask her if she wants to be a good person, she nods and barely touches your nose with tip of hers, which causes her shiver <i>“Y-yes… I w-want to…”</i> You smile and explain to her that you are about to punish Helena in her ass, but wonder if that’s what you should do. <i>“Yes! Punish that whore! That blasphemer! She deserves it!”</i>. Content with teasing her, you pat her head: She has show enough restrain, all things considered, and you now step back. Her disappointment is clear, but retrain is an important quality that she needs to learn. \n\nWhen you are back with Helena, you explain her that now it is time to pay for what she has done. <i>“S-Sorry! I apologize, I… I can’t control myself, is not my fault!”</i> She begs, but her dripping cunt is evidence that she is looking forward to her punishment. Didn’t expected less from this slut. \n\nYou take this time a heavy paddle and you start to scold her while spanking her. You are careful tho, since you believe she has received a lot already and you wouldn’t want her to miss her job because of injuries, but still good enough to get your point across with Itzel. \n\nWhile you keep doing this, it is clear that Itzel is now pretty aroused, and you can see how she struggles with the ropes, trying to untie herself to probably masturbate at the show, but she just cant get free.
