			Board.text = "During a meeting with Abbadon, "+heshe+" suggests you to start to think seriously about rebuilding the ruined church. Since the spiritual needs of the citizens are unfulfilled their discontent grows by the day. \n\n<i>“You know I am not very fond of religion or this mumbo-jumbo, but it will help to distract th people, give them hope, and keep them in check. Actually, you should go and visit the ruins today, maybe that would give you ideas to where to start.”</i>\n\nYou know "+heshe+" has a point, and you decide to take "+himher+" up on "+hisher+" advice. You go to the location of the former church; its blackened ruins are still standing, and seem to exude an aura of utter hopelessness to onlookers.\n\nThe problem you face can’t be just fixed with gold. Without a priest even if you return this place to its former glory you’ll just be faced with an empty shell... that could do as much harm as just leaving the building be.\n\nWhile you are pondering these issues and the few options available to you, the sound of movement inside the destroyed building disturbs you. Although it’s probably just a homeless person, and you have none of your guards around you decide to investigate nonetheless.\n\nOnce inside, you see that there is a beautiful and voluptuous woman, praying before the decrepit altar. \n\nYou cough to get her attention, the woman nearly jumps out of her skin as she turns around.\n\n<i>“Ah! Hi! I’m sorry, I was just looking around... not that there is much left to look at...”</i> The woman is clearly a foreigner; if the obvious difference in skin tone weren’t proof enough, her accent certainly finishes the job.\n\nYou’re fairly sure a caravan hasn’t run through your city in weeks, and it’s strange to find someone who’d dare travel on their own. She’s clearly oblivious as to who you are, which will help with finding out what she’s doing here.\n\nWith a friendly demeanor you ask her what she is doing here and who she is. <i>I apologize for my rudeness! It’s just that I just arrived and I am a little tired... My name is Itzel, a priestess! Admittedly a new one... I was sent here to help guide the city’s citizens once more.”</i> Her face sinks a little bit. <i>”But with this place in ruins, I don’t think I’ll be able to do much.”</i>\n\nPerhaps the gods are dipping their hand; fate is truly favoring you today. Although the girl seems far too young and inexperienced, at least she presents a better alternative to your other church-restoration-options.\n\nIntrigued, you ask her who sent her. <i>“Ah well, the archbishop sent me here. He told me that I was supposed to meet with an important noble... Abbadon I believe, to talk about what my role is to be. Sadly he hasn’t turned up yet, and after waiting for two days to be escorted I lost hope of that.</i> \n\nThat bastard! "+HESHE+" could had at least warned you about what was going on! Or at least provide accommodations for the girl! It seems "+HESHE+" will always be a cheapskate at heart.\n\nYou tell her that you know Abbadon, but that she is better off talking with you regardless. <i>“Are you sure? The archbishop told me that Abbadon was pretty much in charge of this city.”</i> \n\nA scowl immediately erupts across your face... although it’s obvious that such news might travel very slowly the archbishop <i>should</i> know of your existence. Sadly you can bet that Abbadon isn’t in any hurry to pass along the information that "+HESHE+" is no longer in charge.\n\nYou inform the young priestess that as a matter of fact you are in charge of the city. Admittedly it’s a relatively recent change in management.\n\n<i>“Is that so?...”</i> she immediately bows and begins to apologize profusely <i>“I’m sorry my "+lord+" , if I had known I would have been more respectful!”</i> you tell her that she can calm down, it’s hardly her fault. If anything Abbadon is the one who should be apologizing, but that definitely won’t be happening any time soon. \n\n<i>“I-I see... Well my "+lord+" , allow me to formally present myself and my purpose in your city then. My name is Itzel, your humble missionary. I have been sent from our holy church in the name of our Goddess of Love, Servilia, and our Goddess of order, Cornelia, to rebuild the spiritual community of this city... I am not sure how knowledgeable you are about the scriptures, since I have heard... and now seen that there hasn’t been a church here since the outbreak.</i> She casts her eyes around the devastated building with a hint of longing and sadness. <i>”And therefore my secondary mission is to teach about to those who want to know. Would... Y-you like to learn about it?”</i>\n\nShe looks nervous, which you find cute. You could just ignore her religious teachings, but you know whether you like it or not, a church will be rebuilt in the city sooner rather than later. Having a say in what is established it’s critical for your quest for power. Of course, you could just be arbitrary about it, but who knows what will be the result of that.";

Do you have any news about rebuilding the church? You know, I can’t rest very well until this issue is settled... Preaching on the streets has been really tiring, so I feel I can’t be that useful to you until this is done. But once it is, we can absolutely turn our attentions to and talk about other matters, and further improve this healing city!”</i> \n\nItzel, displaying her usual energy and nonstop chatter at least seems excited about what’s next; for once a good change in this bedeviled city.\n\nYou inform her that your decision has been reached; the church will be dedicated to either Cornelia, goddess of discipline, or Servilia, goddess of love?";

Once the sun had settled and the majority of your staff were enjoying some free time, you made your way to her current residence. When you arrived you were greeted by a tiny little building placed just in front of (what is at least still currently the ruins of) the church. You gently knock on the door and can already hear her rushing to open it, and she performs a short bow once she sees you.\n\n<i>“Good evening my "+lord+" , please, come in and join me.”</i> You nod and enter the place. Although her home is rather humble, there is a cozy feeling about it. What space on the floor that’s available is decorated with pelts, and small effigies of saints and gods rest on a tiny shelf on the wall. A fireplace is the main source of lighting, and in front of it there is small table, a couch and an armchair. \n\nAlthough you expected her to be mad still, after she takes the coach she invites you to sit at her side. <i>“Tea?”</i> You accept her invitation and thank her for her kindness. The hot beverage is surprisingly sweet, probably how she likes it, although it doesn’t taste bad.\n\n<i>“So... is there any specific reason you decided to come tonight?”</i> she asks with a calm tone; apparently she is legitimately ignorant in regards to your motives. You explain to her that you want to talk about why you chose to build the church in the name of Astrid. \n\nShe shakes her head softly <i>“Don’t worry about it, I am not mad because of it and you owe me no explanation, but if you want to share your reasons with me, I welcome them.”</i> ";

I am a silly idealist, you know? I have maybe too much faith — not in the Goddess of course — there is never too much faith one could have for them, but I mean the people... I like to think they all will do what’s best, but deep down I know you might be right. At least in the case of this city. Maybe... it’s hard for me to change, but I will do what I can do adapt to this city’s needs. Don't worry about that.”</i> \n\n<i>“Well, this has been very insightful, but it’s getting late my Liege, lets save talking for another day. There is still a lot of work to do to rebuild this place.”</i> You thank her for the tea, her time, and her support.

I am certain that you want nothing but the best for the city... Perhaps I am too stiff about changing my own ways, but I will give it a chance... I mean, it’s not like I have a choice, but I will truly do my best.”</i> \n\nYou are glad to hear that, and at least she acknowledges that this is nothing personal. <i>“I’ve been reading about Astrid lately, I need to know more about her if I want to preach her word... At least I can see now why she is so popular, she truly cares for others, and having real unconditional love is something special...”</i> she looks down for a second, and for the briefest moment you swear you can feel real loneliness in her last words, but she changes the subject before you get a chance to address it. \n\n<i>“Well, this has been very insightful, but it’s getting late my Liege, lets save talking for another day.

You know what I mean, I thought this was going to take months, but I have managed to get a lot of citizens to help us, and that really makes me happy!”</i> Her affable expression is probably the reason why so many are eager to help her. \n\nYou wonder if there is something else you can do to speed things up, but she happily shakes her head. <i>“I don't think so, you have provided us with everything we need, right now it’s about having some patience. But don’t worry, the alchemist has some ideas and tricks, and a number of other resources that may help us get this done faster than with strictly traditional means.”</i> \n\nWell, good news is always welcome. You ask her what’s next on the chopping block. She makes a slight wince at the analogy. <i>“Well, I don’t really know, but I have been teaching people how to spread the word of the Goddess and they will take my place in preaching her word on the street from time-to-time so that I can take a break. Would... You like to have some diner or a drink with me?”</i> \n\nYou rise an eyebrow in surprise, and her face goes red. <i>“D-dont get me wrong! I-I just think this would help us work together better. For the wellbeing of the city!”</i> You smile, fairly sure it really is just that; she doesn’t seem the kind for ulterior motives. Whatever the case it sounds reasonable, and getting to know each other isn’t a bad idea if that gives you an edge for changing the city. \n\n<i>“Very well. I assume you’re too busy right this moment but please feel free to come to my house.

From a block away you can see the smoke flowing lazily from her chimney, and when you arrive to the front, you give a peek through the window, where you can see her struggling in the kitchen. You hear her scream something, and while you can’t understand what she said, you are certain that it was something profane. \n\nDeciding not to rush, you wait a couple of minutes outside until you believe things have calmed down before knocking the door. When you do, she opens the door showing you her happy, usual face, as if nothing has happened. \n\n<i>“Greetings! Glad to see you again, I was wondering when would you come again... Please, come in! I was just... Cooking... Well, or trying to do so.”</i> you tell her that if its not a good moment, you can come another day, but she takes your hand and pulls you inside before closing the door. \n\n<i>“It’s fine! Please just take a seat, it was nothing serious... you can only learn by screwing things up right? I have some well done porridge if you want... Although you’re probably used to fancy food up there in the castle, a humble meal would certainly bring you closer to our Goddess.”</i> \n\nYou accept some even though you are not particularly... excited, for the food, but that’s probably the point of the whole thing. She nods her head and returns to her little kitchen to serve a bowl for each of you. \n\nOnce she is back, she sits at your side again in the couch. Before you taste it she stops you. <i>“Shouldn’t we pray and thank the Gods for our meal?”</i> Whether you care or not, it’s likely you have no escape from this particular ritual. You muster up a smile and ask her to take the lead. It takes her a couple of minutes to thank several Gods, and saints that you have never heard of before she is finished. \n\n<i>“That’s all, lets proceed”</i> You gladly do so, tasting the porridge... Tasting might have been a poor choice of words; you had almost forgotten the flavor of the painfully bland food that was common during your youth. In a way it almost makes you nostalgic about your past. <i>“So how is it?”</i> You tell her that she was right about the... humbling experience. \n\n<i>“Glad to hear that, although I sense that this is not your first time eating something as plain as this. I’ve seen rich people before trying this for the first time — food that doesn’t cost what the poor earns in a year — and their reactions were definitely different.”</i> \n\nYou tell her that she is right, that actually you’ve been living in the forest since you were a child because of the assassination of your father by the late lord — your uncle. \n\n<i>“O-oh... I am sorry, I didn’t know about that... People here either don’t want to, or can’t talk about you. I apologize for being so insensitive.”</i> You say that she shouldn’t worry much about it, you barely remember anything about that, or the city, although you are glad that your mother returned recently. \n\nItzel bounces in her seat with a bright smile <i>“Seriously?! That sounds great! That must be the wish of the Gods for you to have that luck!”</i> You aren’t so sure about that, considering the situation your mother’s situation... but you should probably leave <i>that</i> discussion for another day.\n\nTo change the topic you ask about her, and her story. <i>“About me? Where to start... I am from the Viceroyalty of Tzime, a capital city in the middle of the jungle. The city is like a veeery big fortress, without a doubt the second largest after the citadel itself. \n\nTheir reign was fighting for the control of the island against the citadel, but as you may expect they ultimately lost the war. In any case, I am an orphan, and I’ve lived with the church for as long as I can remember. They taught me everything I know, and shortly before the plague I moved to the neighboring city, Ku-Jiang, where I served as an acolyte until not long ago.”</i> She takes a long breath after that, and her face sinks a little.\n\n<i>“When the plague started, well... Those were very confusing times, but long story short, pretty much every city was isolated after it, with little to no trade. We were left with no veracity to any news from the other cities since most people that actually traveled ended up corrupted themselves.”</i> \n\nYou ask if that is the case with her <i>“W-what? N-no! Of course not! Do I look corrupted to you?”</i> You shrug, saying that you are no expert on the topic. She shakes her head and rejects your question, but you ask her if that’s not what a corrupt person would do. She sighs, frustrated and obviously a little insulted. <i>“I promise we can talk about that another day but... Let me finish my story tonight”</i> Fine, you apologize for interrupting her story. \n\n\n<i>“It’s fine. Where I was? Ah right... Yes, I those were some harsh times, we lost a lot of people during those days to the plague. But we kept our hopes high and I kept up my education so that I could become a priestess someday. I guess I could regale you with so many anecdotes about those times, but this is the substance of it. A couple of months before I came we had news that the church in this city was destroyed and the priest had run away or otherwise disappeared. I offered myself as a volunteer to come here and preach the word, since the church itself was reluctant to send some by their own. And... That’s actually how I became a priestess too, since they ordained me just a couple of weeks before my departure.”</i> \n\nIt is impossible for you to hide your surprise and skepticism about this. She gives you a not-so-serious angry face in reaction <i>“I know what you may be thinking, but although my title is new, remember that I’ve been with the church since I was a child, I know everything that there is to know about religious matters.”</i> \n\nYou admit that that’s true, but managing a church is more than theology: It’s politics, it is charisma, and it’s being able to make hard choices. She is about to answer, but stops to give the moment some consideration. After a pause, she continues <i>“You may be right... I lack that experience, and... Yeah, remember I said earlier? You screw up while learning?... But I don't want to disappoint you nor the city, so... Would you help me do the right thing?”</i> \n\nYou smile; of course you will, in the end, her failure would harm you too. <i>“I know... But you should do the good just for the sake of it right? But I suppose it doesn’t matter, so long we end up helping the city.”</i> That’s what matters.\n\nEven though you are enjoying the night, you can see that she is pretty tired. After her fourth-or-so yawn you decide to wrap up for the day. <i>“Thanks for coming my Liege, I hope you come more often. It was a pleasant night! My door is always open so just come whenever you want.”</i> You appreciate her gesture... especially when before leaving she jumps to her feet and gives you a small kiss on the cheek. With a smile you pat her head before leaving. \n";

Also since we are getting some attention other important people are sending some free help, like Junia, who provides us with drinks and food for the volunteers, which motivates those who are in need to also help. In short, the whole city is helping, and it’s a great feeling and a great start.

Whether you believe it or not, the superstitious population will, and will thank you for bringing change, even though it would had happen even without your help.

Well, I’ve never really had that much free time, nor I am the kind of girl that goes wild you know, so usually reading or helping around: Cleaning, farming, things like that”</i> \n\nYeah, you can imagine her being kind of boring like that, although you also believe that if she tried to go wild and indulge in the party life a little she would be fun to have around. You of course omit your opinion, but ask her if once the church is done, she would like to enjoy the city and herself more. She laughs, though not in an offensive manner.\n\n<i>“I am glad that you care about my well being, and that’s why I am sure you will be a great leader for this city. Since you insist, I am willing to try to have some... uh, fun, but please feel free to plan something since obviously I am a bit out of my depth with these things.”</i> You nod and tell her that she doesn’t have to worry, you will take care of it.  \n\nOnce the dinner is over, and it’s getting late, you decide to go back to your castle. <i>“Thanks again for your visit, I am eager to see what you have in mind for the next time!

Very well, tonight, you say, it’s important first we make clear why this is important, not just for herself, but for the whole city. \n\n<i>“But I Already k-”</i> You stop her, yes she <i>knows</i> but she still doesn’t realize what level of responsibility she has. As someone who has been dealing with this for a while now, you know how critical it is for her to understand how dire the situation could get. \n\nShe stays quiet and nods, and you proceed to talk about how now she will face hard choices, choices that will change and shape herself, the city, the life of it’s citizens, and the overall success or failure of the state itself. \n\nThere are little room for mistake in these harsh times where civilizations are hang by a thread. She seems overwhelmed by your words, but you relax your tone a little and tell her that this is why she needs to trust you and others in your administration too, working together but also vigilant of failure. \n\nThe last topic of the night is about how she is responsible for others too, specially those under her command and who hear her very advice and guide, but also that it is negligent to see others plotting and behaving wrongly and letting them go. \n\n<i>“But... I am not good at scolding people!”</i> You answer that that’s something that the both of us will work together on in the following days. And not just <i>scolding</i>, but punishing appropriately as well. <i>“P-punishing?... That sounds to harsh...”</i> Yes, but these times are harsh as well, you reply. \n\nShe nods, and although you want to continue, she is falling asleep at this point, and you take her to her bed before going back home. \n\n";

Okay.”</i> she stops pestering you, starting to comprehend the circumstances that are being presented. \n\nYou walk for half an hour, slowly depending into the more depraved parts of town. While the two of you started in the well lit, prestigious commercial district, you soon find yourselves in the dim, seedy red-light district. \n\nThe place, as expected, is filled with deviants, selling themselves for coin, pleasure, or any type of substance to satiate their desires. The buildings are in a state of decay, falling apart past the point of repair and salvage. You ask her if she has been here before. \n\n<i>“O-of course not! Why would I?”</i> To help, of course, those in need. <i>“Eh... Yeah, that’s a good reason but, still, I rather stick to the main square of the city...

This place is disturbing...”</i> She is talking about the sound of moans of pleasure and pain that echo throughout the street.\n\nThis is what happens when freedom runs amok and nothing is done about it. Why isn’t the entire city like this? Because society have norms and rules put into place that forbid it, and guards to enforce the law, to maintain a sense of order and decency. <i>“But why there are no guards here?”</i> \n\nWell, the leadership of the city failed, with perversion and corruption  growing strong in this place, to the point that you can’t easily tackle the issue. It is why you need to become powerful in the city, in order to cleanse this place, to make a difference. \n\n<i>“I... I’ll help you my Liege, I... Agree that this is too much, it’s... Let’s just leave now please? Can we? I learned the lesson right?”</i> You smile, knowing that there are even worse lessons out there, but you don’t want to cause her to have a panic attack, so you pat her head and decide to accompany her back at her home.\n\n<i>“I feel... Like I need to thank you, the church always protected us from the cruel world. We helped the poor and others, but in hindsight, I think they only allowed us to go to the nicer places on Ku-Jiang... Maybe they feared that we would get corrupted...

I need to test myself, go beyond my bounds, and internalize this deep inside me. But, for now, I need to rest...

There can be balance too of course; certain roles may require more freedom than others, but nonetheless you believe that Itzel must change in order to fit your vision of the future.  \n\nBut the process to change her needs to be subtle, otherwise you know she will just refuse, maybe even escape, so you come up with a plan.

Should I prepare only one, or do you need them in bulk?”</i> You ask her for what you think should suffice for your plans, grinning eagerly.

Although you are certain that she has been exposed to corruption at some point, it’s not nearly enough to actually know and understand what it is. If she <i>did</i>, things would be different, she would understand that corruption doesn’t make you a bad or a good person, but just liberates you from the unnatural social norms that try to control our lives. \n\nYou know there is nuance, that too much corruption and society will crumble and disappear, but no corruption at all will simply lead to a life lost of freedom and mired in slavery. There can be balance too of course; certain roles may require more freedom than others, but nonetheless you believe that Itzel must change in order to fit your vision of the future.  \n\nBut the process to change her needs to be subtle, otherwise you know she will just refuse, maybe even escape, so you come up with a plan. One of the benefits of your position, and the fact that you allow and help fund the efforts to rebuild the church, is that you have almost unlimited access to anything related to it, so you go and contact the carpenters guild in charge of the furniture. \n\nYou ask them to see the people who are building the confessional. Once you have the people you require in front of you, you ask them to build the piece with certain “specifications” pretty much with sliding panels that can transform the confessional into a glory hole, with one typical small overture suited for any kind of dicks. It wouldn’t hurt to also add a bigger, oval shape that could be used for a woman too, or anyone who wants to stick their ass through it. \n\nDays go by until everything in the church is set, and in the meantime, if you want deceive her you’ll need a disguise. In this case for your voice, so you pay a visit to the Elizabeth the alchemist, and ask her if she can give you a potion that can temporally change your voice. \n\n<i>“Uh... Oddly specific, but I think I can do it, sure. Should I prepare only one, or do you need them in bulk?”</i> You ask her for what you think should suffice for your plans, grinning eagerly. Once the church starts to operate almost at its fullest you start to pay attention to Itzel’s schedule, to figure out when she goes into the confessional to hear people.\n\nFinally, you decide to pay your first visit. The voice you use this time is inconspicuous, but first you want to make sure that everything is working as it should. You “confess” petty crimes and stuff, and she attentively hears you and answers your questions, being forgiving and merciful as expected, and never doubting your sincerity or realizing it was you. \n\nYou leave that day without making much progress, but with confidence that you can move forward with your plans.

If it is for the city...”</i> Yes, it is, and you thank her for agreeing with you. \n\n<i>“We’ll start tomorrow, tonight I think I need to rest well.”</i> You tell her that she doesn’t have to worry, that you will take care of this and everything will be fine.

Still, the woman is unruly and really doesn’t care about  authority, which is great, since there would be no point on correcting someone who already behaves. \n\nAs the guards prepare the woman, Itzel arrives on time. <i>“My Liege”</i> she bows to you <i>“I am eager and ready to start, what is the case to deal with?”</i> You like how she has become serious regarding the job. \n\nThe unruly woman screams and kicks one of the guards while they are restraining her in the table, face down. The guard is about to hit her, but you command him to stop before he does so. The guard apologizes, and you ask them to leave. <i>“I guess this needs no explanation... Will you come with me?”</i> you nod to Itzel, your intentions clear. <i>“Very well. I shall not disappoint you”</i> She better not. \n\nShe goes down stairs while you enter and close the door behind you, but you stay over there, looking without interfering. \n\nWhen the woman sees who will be dealing with him, she starts to talk and beg to Itzel <i>“H-hey! You l-look like a sweet girl, right? Please tell those men to liberate me, I have done nothing wrong!”</i> \n\nItzel doesn’t answer, instead she walks to a desk and takes the horse whip that you used the last time. She touches it, and examines the tail of the whip with her open hand. The woman, seeing her actions, starts to get nervous. <i>“W-whats going on? I-”</i> Itzel hits her without prior notice and the woman screams out in surprise and pain. \n\n<i>“Ah! Why ar-”</i> she tries to say, but Itzel hits her again. During the next few minutes, even before Itzel mutters a word, she keeps hitting the woman each time she dares to speak, until she understands. \n\n<i>“It took you some time to grow quiet. Are you some kind of masochist?”</i> inquires Itzel <i>“No I-”</i> Itzel hits her again when she tries to answer <i>“It’s a rhetorical question... You know, the kind of question that you don’t need to answer.”</i> she walks to the other side of the table, where Itzel bends over and grabs the woman’s chin to inspect her face. \n\n<i>“You are pretty, but I guess that’s not the reason why you are here... Or maybe it is.”</i> The woman is frightened, tears close to coming out her eyes, but you can see that Itzel is barely keeping herself together, mustering all her strength to put up a tough front. The woman manages to nod.\n\n<i>“Very well, you shall speak, but only to tell the truth. If I sense the slightest doubt in your voice I will punish you. Understood?”</i> The woman sheepishly nods. Once everything is settled, Itzel begins the lesson <i>“Let’s start... Why are you here?”</i> the woman sobs <i>“I don’t know! Ah!”</i> Itzel reacts instantly, punishing her as fast as she tries to deceive her.\n\nItzel keeps pressuring her over and over until the woman finally breaks. <i>“P-Please no more! I’ll talk! S-Stop!”</i> \n\nItzel gives her a chance to talk, but starts to caress her body from the top to the bottom with the tail of her horse whip, keeping her on edge. \n\n<i>“I confess! I’ve been seducing young men! Their strong bodies and vitality are the only way I can feel satisfied!... I’m sorry! I didn’t intended to do wrong... I just... Wanted a good dick up in my old cunt...”</i> That’s what everyone says, well, the <i>I’m sorry part</i> at least, but Itzel, kind as she is, accepts this apologies and starts to pat the womans head and gives her a kiss in the forehead. <i>“It’s fine, it wasn’t that hard, right?”</i> asks with her usual kind tone, and the woman, still in fear, just nods. \n\nBut something is changing, you can see how the face of Itzel is turning red and shows and displays a subtle smile <i>“Accepting the truth is a good first step, but is not enough, now it is time to get your proper punishment.”</i> the woman, believing further torture is about to come, starts to beg, but Itzel ignores her pleas and goes to the table. \n\nAfter a minute, she finally decides to take a ribbed strap. She walks in front of the woman and to her surprise, Itzel starts to get naked, exposing her overflowing pussy, lovely chest and cute ass. You are certain she is dying to just assault the woman’s mouth with her nether parts but she manages to control herself. She has some trouble fastening the strap-on, being this the first time, but to you this only adds to the charm of the scene. \n\nOnce she has it on, the confidence of Itzel goes through the roof <i>“It is time to pay for your sins, you whore, but is up to you how harsh I shall be. You have a minute to suck this before I destroy your ass, so make sure you get it as wet as possible.”</i> \n\nThe woman, in shock, doesn’t move for a few seconds but when she realizes that Itzel is serious about it she starts to suck it with a lot of diligence, not with pleasure or lust but out of pure effectiveness and desperation. Once the minute is finished, Itzel removes the restrains of the woman, so she can force her to bend over on the table. \n\n<i>“Make sure to spread wide, whore. As you do with those young men”</i> The woman doesn’t just spread, but also uses her hands to pull her cheeks apart to create an inviting opening for Itzel. \n\nShe doesn’t even warn her, she just starts fucking her hard. <i>“Repent while I punish you! Be loud and clear!”</i> The woman, between her heavy breaths, tries to do so.\n\n <i>“I repent for e-enjoying young dicks! I-I rep-pent for s-sucking som-meone... Ah!... Else in the morning the m-minute my husband goes... Ah!... way!

I need a hand...”</i> she says to you. You pull out of the woman’s mouth and come to Itzel’s side.\n\n<i>“Please... We... Are not done yet... B-but I need your help...”</i> Itzel begs, and she slowly opens her legs and spreads her butt cheeks with her hands. <i>“Lets... Lets punish her together...”</i> Her inviting little butthole is too tempting to reject at this point, and your dick is already lubricated by that woman’s saliva, so you decide to go forward, but slow so you don't harm Itzel too much. \n\nWhen the tip is in, she shouts of pain, and to distract her you start to pinch her nipples. Your face is too close to hers, and you make eye contact with her. You can feel the sexual tension, both of you wanting to let go all the religious lectures and just go wild. With every inch of your hot rod that enters her, your faces get closer and closer, stopping only an inch away from each other. \n\nShe knows she shouldn’t do it, and she knows she needs to be strong for the city, and when you are about to do it she suddenly moves her hips, the pleasure of her tight ass distracts you from your impure desires.\n\nItzel starts moving backwards and forward, penetrating the woman again and herself in the process. She moves your hands from her chest to her hips <i>“Use all your might! Make this woman regret her sins!”</i> \n\nYou start to fuck Itzel with all your strength, to the point that you start to dig your nails into her cheeks, but she begs you to continue. You keep going and going, until Itzel starts to moan of pleasure.

That’s great news!”...</i> she says, excited but tired. \n\nYou tell her that there is only one thing left to do, and she looks at you puzzled <i>“W-what is that? I don't remember anything else...”</i> that’s because she is tired, but is nothing hard, she only need to gets on her knees, look up, and open her mouth , she does without protest. <i>“Like this?”</i> exactly, you explain that she is about to be baptized by you, and to not waste anything.\n\n At this point, both of you need some release and play along, she starts to masturbate her still virgin pussy while you jerk off. It doesn’t take long until you are at the edge again, and with some ceremony you pronounce some religious babble while finally removing the lace of your dick, pushing you over the edge. You shoot load after load, hitting her face, hair and naked chest.

At first everything goes smooth and normally, and of course Itzel pretends as if she doesn’t know you or even that she remembers the last time at all. To be fair that may be part of her routine nonetheless. \n\nBefore you go on, you look outside. There are still a scattered handful of people around, but no one who is interested in a confession. It doesn’t hurt that you told some of your guards to make sure no one else enters the church with any bullshit excuse. It may not work for long, but this should at least buy you an hour of peace.\n\n <i>“Is everything all right?”</i> she asks, concerned by your sudden pause, but you say that is just... You still have problems with what you mentioned the other day. <i>“T-The other day? I am n-not sure about what are you talking about... I hear a lot of confessions, you know...”</i>.\n\nYou smile, you knew she was trying to play dumb, but that’s fine. You tell her that you had... An issue, and that she tried to help you with some guidance, but that you really <i>couldn’t make it work</i> and that the situation has been worsening. \n\n<i>“Ah... Yes, I think I remember now...”</i> She pauses, trying to muddle through the last part of what you said. <i>“W-Worse? That’s bad... but I am not sure what I can do to help you my child...”</i> Well, that’s where she is wrong, you tell her that maybe she could <i>show you</i> how to properly do it. \n\n<i>“T-That’s wrong!... I c-can’t do that!”</i> is it really wrong? You ask, because she said it was natural and something everyone does. <i>“Y-Yes but... Ah...”</i> internally, she is struggling between her modesty and what you told her the other day about going beyond the call of duty.\n\nFinally, you can hear her sighing, <i>“F-Fine, but only once... So pay close attention.”</i> She opens the small hole in the booth, you remember how the carpenters had to apologize for these “mistakes”, but you told Itzel that they could come handy if, in example, the person was mute and had to hand her a written confession or something. Not the best excuse, but at least she stopped caring about it shortly afterward.  \n\n<i>“J-just... Look through the hole... I’ll start in a minute...”</i> You can see the totally ashamed, beet-red face of Itzel, who is trying to get in position for the show. She puts her feet on the bench where she is sitting, rises up her skirt, showing off a cute pussy. On realizing that she’s actually already drenched in sticky fluids you give her a compliment, telling her how cute it is. \n\n<i>“T-T-Thanks...”</i> she barely manages to say, and slowly starts to move her hand down there. <i>“P-Please pay at-tention... I w-wont do this again!”</i> she repeats herself, and with trembling hands she starts to touch herself, first the clit, making circles around it and very softly pinching it. \n\n<i>“T-this is the most important thing... Make s-sure to be nice with it... Ah!...”</i> she let’s go a loud moan, and she instantly reacts by covering it with her other hand. <i>“S-Sorry... But... That happens if you a-are doing a good job...”</i> she proceeds by going down, starting to penetrate herself first with a single finger, but once there is a small pool of fluids underneath her she inserts a second one. <i>“B-Be careful while doing this... You don’t want to h-hurt yourself if it’s your first time...”</i>.\n\nAlthough you expected her to stop at this point, to your surprise she actually keeps going, and faster by the minute, until she is properly masturbating as if she was alone, but then, she suddenly stops. <i>“...Wait.”</i> You can see she looks outside, and when she is certain no one is around, she starts to get naked \n\n<i>“W-when you do this, you n-need to be naked...”</i> she goes back in position but this time she plays with her nipples. She is enjoying herself too much, and you feel glad that this is going better and faster than you expected. \n\nShe goes for five minutes until she is on the edge <i>“I-I am about to c-come! P-please look at me c-cumming!”</i> she arches her back and starts to have a very violent orgasm, wetting all the clothes that she left on the floor. When she is done, you can see a satisfied smile in her face, and it takes a minute or two to recover. \n\n<i>“S-see my child... This is how is done...”</i> You thank her and say that you will try this at home. <i>“Y-yes, you do that...”</i> before you leave, you ask if you can come back for further lessons. <i>“Ah... That’ll be fine...”</i>.\n\nWhen you leave the booth, you can see there are people surrounding it, it seems like the guards let these people enter shortly after she looked outside, and they heard most of it. At least they don't know who is at the other side of the booth, bur rumors will spread fast... \n\nDays after your adventure, Itzel goes to your castle and talks about the advice you gave her. <i>“You know my Liege, you were right, it <b>feels good</b> to do the right thing.”</i> You laugh at her cynicism, but just pretend you don't understand what she means. <i>“Let’s just say that now I will really do my best for the city without fear anymore.”</i> happy with your progress, the next step should be pretty easy to handle.\n";

Are you alright?”</i> she ask with legitimate concern. Yeah, you reassure her, it’s just that an alchemist fell and you, being on his way, got transformed by one of his potions. <i>“Oh that sounds horrible!... In what way did that potion change you, if I may ask?”</i> You explain that it didn’t changed your race or anything, it’s just that now you have... well, the other type of genitalia. \n\n<i>“Ah... I see...”</i> She doesn’t really know what to say, so you continue talking about your new struggles: That now, it is pretty obvious when you feel like that, and although you touch it’s not working, since you get hard again in no time. \n\n<i>“It’s because you need to get used to it... I think.”</i> whatever the case, you tell her you didn’t want to talk about it because you feel like an abomination. <i>“No of course no my child!

Of course, We at the church are here to help, right?”</i> You ask what you should do. <i>“Just... let me check something.”</i> You can hear how she opens her door to see if there is people around again, and with the place almost empty, she decides to proceed. \n\n<i>“Fine, we can go, but this time we need to be quiet...”</i> she opens the glory hole <i>“Let’s get naked first.”</i> You see her stripping her clothes off sensually, letting go her long hair, showing her very thin and feminine body. She even turns around and bends over a little, showing off a cute butt hole. When she is done, she moves closer to the gloryhole, where you can see her cunt in detail. <i>“First I will repeat the last lesson, just in case you return to your old body... It’s important that you don’t touch yourself, just look.”</i>\n\nWithout adding more, she starts to masturbate standing, more eager than the last time, since right now she was already overflowing with excitement. In no time she has a couple of fingers inside, pinching her nipples with the other hand, and biting her lower lip, trying to stop herself from moaning. Although you enjoy the music of sex in that booth: The sound of her hand clashing with her wet nether parts, her heavy breathing, and when she pinches herself too hard and squeaks out muffled moans. She has moved so close to the glory hole, that you could lick her if you wanted, but you don’t want to screw up the situation. \n\nShe goes for five minutes until she has her first orgasm. <i>“Ah!... Ah!... D-Don’t miss this part... Ah!...”</i> she begs to you while cumming, and you indulge yourself, enjoying how the little priestess shivers with pleasure until she is finally sitting on her knees in a pool of her own fluids. \n\n<i>“T-that was good... W-what you think?”</i> You are not sure how to answer, so you just answer that it was good too. <i>“Ah... Ah... W-Well... Now let me h-help you...

I have an idea.”</i> \n\nYou can feel a silky and smooth sensation around your dick, its soft touch very unique, and you ask her what is she exactly doing. <i>“I... Am going to use my hair, I... Think our skins shouldn’t touch yet. But I can teach you how to do this properly like this. Or should I stop?”</i> You shake your head even she isn’t able to see you and tell her that no, of course she shouldn’t stop, and urge her to keep going. <i>“Hehe... Very well, you will love this!... I hope.”</i> She whispers the last thing, still insecure about her skills. \n\nAlthough she talks a lot about teaching and what not, she is actually very clumsy, and if you have to guess, you’ll assume this is her first time doing this. You think she has probably read about things like that in books about Servilia or another horny Goddess, but she only has only learned the theory. Not like you mind, there is something special and unique about inexperienced hands, it will just take longer for her to satisfy you.\n\nShe starts to increase her pace, pumping you harder, and she seems to try to complement her awkward job by blowing the tip of your head, a nice fresh sensation that makes the experience more complete.  <i>“Are you enjoying this?...”</i> \n\nShe asks with a dubious voice, and you encourage her, saying that this is very good. <i>“Ah thanks!... I... Wish I had more experience... But I will learn. Can I ask you a favour? Please, just tell me when you are ready to release.”</i> You tell her that she has nothing to worry about, and she becomes more eager. \n\nThe hairjob goes for a while, but finally, you are on your edge. You tell her as promised, and you can hear her nervous answer. <i>“Ah... Please wait a second, I need to make sure you don’t taint this place!”</i> \n\nYou do the best to hold up and you can feel how she is doing something with her hair. You can feel your whole tip is surrounded by the smooth texture, and finally, she is ready for you. <i>“Ah... I will go hard, make sure to shoot every load until you are satisfied!”</i> Between her hands, and your short hip movement, you cum in no time. You shoot load after load, feeling not just great physical pleasure, but at the same time you feel like your action is changing your soul and hers at the same time, a sensation that has no physical equivalent.\n\nWhen you don’t have a single drop of cum in your body, you wonder if she really was able to keep the other place clean. She hasn’t said a word since you were done, but she let your cock free, you’re able to kneel down and see through the hole. \n\nThe sight is pretty great; it seems like she was masturbating herself too and came at the same time than you did, and she is now on the ground, smeared in her fluids, while her hair is totally drenched on your seed. Some of it dripped down to her face and chest, but overall, at least she managed to preserve the floor. You can see she has her eyes open, but you are not sure if she is conscious, since she doesn’t seem to react.\n\nAfter a couple of minutes calling her she finally reacts. <i>“Ah... Sorry... I was in ecstasy... I never felt something like this before...”</i> She struggles to stand up and sit down on the bench. <i>“I... Think I need to go to my home and rest, but you should go first, thats the norm...”</i> You see how a big drop of cum goes through her cheek close to her mouth, and almost as a reflex you can see how she tastes it with her tongue. \n\n<i>“Oh my Goddesss... This tastes so good... Why had no one told me before?!”</i> You can see how she starts to lick up everything thats on her skin, but sadly she knows most of it is wasted. You are weirded out by her reaction, but then you finally remember a side note of the alchemist about the voice changing potion, and how it could kick off other potions you yourself have had. One of these, must have been to make your cum moderately addictive. Oops, well, not like this is bad or anything, but just unexpected.\n\nWhen you are about to go Itzel stops you <i>“Hey... Come back soon, okay? I... Want to know that you are all right. Yeah, because that is my job...”</i> You know that’s not the motive, but you agree, and she laughs with nervous happiness while you leave. ";

You know, I can be of assistance in the meantime, if you want me to.”</i> \n\nReally? You ask with a tone of excitement <i>“Yeah, of course!... T-That’s what we do right, help to those in need... Are you in need, my child?”</i> She can bet you are. <i>“Very well, show it to me.”</i> In no time you get your pussy close to the gloryhole, already wet from excitement. \n\n<i>“...Would you like me to have fun like the last time?... Or maybe you need even <b>more</b> help?”</i> You ask for more and you hear her chuckle. <i>“I expected that, ah... The strength of the youth.”</i> At least, you can feel her soft skin touching your clit first, the sensation of her hot breath. <i>“I was waiting for this delicacy...”</i> \n\nYou can feel her tongue licking your pearl first, before doing a lengthy slurp through your whole pussy, and the sound of enjoyment surrounds the place once she gets a good taste of it. <i>“It’s so great... I will make sure to get everything out, so you’ll have no more problems with it...”</i> In a sense, that even sounds scary, but you know her kind nature will not allow her to hurt anyone.\n\nShe starts to go deeper inside you, enjoying every inch she gets inside, playing with her tongue around, as if trying to memorize the shape of your privates. She goes as deep as she can, and then starts to move up and down. At first, slowly, trying to get a good rhythm, but the more she savors, the faster she goes. \n\nAlthough the last time she was a total amateur, you suspect she has been training how to do this, because this is better than an amateur would do. Her tongue knows where to play, and she changes her head position from time to time to keep the session from being too monotonous. \n\nHalfway through she comments something <i>“Last time we wasted most of the... Release, but you know this liquid is actually sacred for some of the Goddesses? This time I’ll make sure I swallow everything.”</i> after that short pause she goes on, the slurping sounds so strong you can hear they echo through the church. You ask if she isn’t worried about it <i>“Why would I? Should I be ashamed of helping someone in the name of the Goddess?”</i> you laugh and ask her to continue, which she does without protest. \n\nAfter several minutes, you warn her about being close. <i>“Just let yourself go, fill me up my child.”</i> she doubles her speed, and with a grunt you start cumming, tainting her throat and mouth with your juice. \n\nAfter several loads and with a loud sound, you finally get free from her sucking lips, she was forced to drink most of it, but she kept a good mouthful inside. When you kneel down you can see her rinsing her mouth and, finally, doing some gargles with it until she swallows it. <i>“Ah... Refreshing, right?... I guess you won’t have to worry for a while, but if you do, come again.”</i>";

Fine, go ahead! Aaaah...”</i> you stay for a while, looking how she serves cock after cock.

AH!... Fill my ass!... Bless me with your seed! AH!...”</i> You can’t fight her, and start to release load after load inside her, dousing her interior with your sperm. \n\nItzel has a very loud and violent orgasm when you start to cum, but she resists and stays standing until you are done, just to fall on her face immediately afterwards.
