You weren’t sure what to say about it, but you decided to tackle the situation directly and deal with it as soon as you can. As you arrive at the castle, the maids are in disarray as they gossip, as you can hear some commotion. You ask one of the maids about what is going on but you get no answer at first, until one of them stands out and starts talking.\n\n<i>“Oh thank the gods you’re here, my liege”</i> she says.<i>Someone flew into the castle through one of the windows. We don’t know what to do! The guards were unable to deal with the situation, so your mother decided to intervene…”</i> You’re surprised that your mother decided to do such a thing. <i>“We tried to stop her, but she was too fast! Right now, she is trying to stop it at your studio.”</i> She says, as you can hear two voices coming from the corridor that leads to your management studio. As you hurry through it, you notice that the place was a mess. There were pieces of broken vases on the floor, as you can see that the servants were scared of getting too close to the fray. You see the door leading to your studio paired, so you open the door with your shoulder and see that your mother is trying to dialogue with some female that is shouting at the top of her lungs.";

You start to remember that name, as you’re quite sure that is your sister’s name. She looks familiar, yet different. You can see that she grew  from the time that you saw her last time, but now she has horns and wings on her back. Has she been inflicted with the Plague? At least she doesn’t seem to be Lost in it. <i>“Who are you and why did you look like my mother, you monster?!. It was my uncle, isn’t it?!

			Board.text += "\n\nAfter a couple of seconds, both of them look at you as you approach. Your sister has bright red skin, white hair, yellow eyes, horns coming out of her head, she has bat-like wings and a tail that looks dangerously sharp. A closer look shows you that she is wearing some cloth that is clasped to her back and barely covering her lady bits. At first, you can see that some sparks come out from her hand, surprising you. That’s magic… Your sister knows magic? Is that why she has been away for so long?. <i>“Who are you?! Are you one of those puny guards?”</i> she says in a demanding tone. You stand straight and point at her with your index finger, asking her if she was the one responsible of injuring of the guards. After a couple of seconds of silence, your sister takes a good look at you and takes a step closer, her magic dwindling a bit. <i>“Is that you… "+ GameControl.playerName +"”</i>\n\nAfter that question, you lower your hand slowly and nods, your body tense at the thought that she could be angry at you too. You’re not sure of her intentions for now, but you want to know them. After that, she stands straight as her magic dissapears from her hand, her eyes fixed over you. After that, she uses her wings to propel herself in your direction as you get a hand over your weapon. But when you thought that she would strike you with magic, she hugs you with her delicate arms and presses herself against you. You can hear her whining a bit from that position before looking up to your face. <i>I thought you were dead, "+ GameControl.playerName  +"! Last time I saw you was that during that fateful night! I thought you were…</i> she says before rubbing her face against your chest, cleaning her tears in your clothes. You sigh and hug her back a bit, waiting for her to calm down.\n\nWhen you see that she finally calms down, you explain her that you must repair the damage that she did to the castle and to your servants, as you are now the Liege of the city. You tell her that she can take any room she likes and get some rest. There is much to talk about her time away from you, but you have to do it as they are your servants. After that, she cleans her face a bit then nods, before walking out of the place. You can see that the servants slip away from sight as she moves close to them.";

You tell her that you want to know more of what happened to her. She smiles at your remark. <i>“But first, I wanna know about you and your whereabouts! I have the right to know!”</i> she says with an inquisitive tone, so you decide to comply if she starts talking too after it, to which she nods happily. You talk about your time in the forest, and the guardian that your mother placed to take care of you. About your years of training below its wing and how it passed away by thinking in you before itself.\n\nShe looks quite interested in your past. <i>“You’re quite the survivalist, "+ mcpronoun1 +".”</i> she said after hearing your story. After that, you wanted to talk about something a little bit more relaxed, so you want her to remember with you about your childhood. <i>“Well, of course I remember those things. What about you?”</i> she says with doubt in her eyes. You tell her that you remember, but it has been so long since then, that you want to talk with her about some good times. She sighs and nods. <i>“It has been a while, isn’t it?”</i>\n\nSmiling pridefully she puts her book down and sits next to you. “Do you remember that my tutors always said that I had a gift of learning?. That was sure annoying for me. Able to talk, crawl, walk, and solve problems much before others isn’t something that other children see it with good eyes.” You tell her that there were acolytes in the temple, or even some noble people that were ahead of others too, something that made her cross her arms. <i>“They had nothing on me though. Always jealous. Always talking about me behind my back. They were all afraid….. yes, they were all afraid that I was better than them. That I was smarter than them!

She starts floating in front of you, sitting in mid-air and crossing her legs, sighing. <i>“I was learning alchemy from the old one in that dark cave. She taught me about all sorts of alchemical substances and reagents. But inside me I knew that it wasn’t enough. I wasn’t going to destroy my uncle’s grasp over the city with sweet water and smoke bombs.”</i> You raise an eyebrow and motion her to continue her explication.\n\nHer mood saddens a bit as she goes on <i>“Who could have thought? The old one was so old that she couldn’t live in the forest for a while. She died of disease. And with her dying breath she told me not to let my vengeance consume me, well at least she tried to.

After a bit of thought, you decide to ask her the question that has been plaguing your mind since you knew that she was going to a tutor when you were child, but you never had the chance to say it out loud. You can see that she is quite interested in reading a book that she has in her hands, but yet you ask her if you’re capable of doing magic on your own.\n\nYour sister drops her book and turns her head to you after that, as if its something that she has been waiting for a while. <i>“You want to learn magic, "+ GameControl.playerName +"?”</i> She takes a deep breath and leave the book on the side. <i>“You see, its not that simple. The rituals are complicated even for the beginning of the conjuration. I had the chance to learn it fast, because this demon helped me with the understanding of the world. He literally poured the knowledge in me…”</i> You can see that she keeps thinking about it, as if mentioning the pact is something that bothers her a little, even when she is trying to hide that fact, but you know where to look.\n\nYou tell her that you’ve thought about it for a while, and you decided to pour all your effort into this, to dedicate a lot of time in learning on how to harness the magic that she knows how to use. You can see that she keeps her eyes on yours, sighing after a couple of seconds. <i>“How can I say no to my blood? I will try and teach you how to do it. No promises okay?”</i> You nod at her, as you know that there is the possibility that you’re a complete failure on magic. You’ve never studied in an academy for more than a couple of months. You’re not that sure that you have the discipline needed for this kind of “art”.\n\nShe stands up and uses her magic to slowly float to a higher shelf and takes a book that looks quite old. <i>“I hope that I’m a good teacher. You will be my first student. And its hard for me to teach as I just kinda… feel the magic around me.”</i> She takes a good look at the book’s pages for a bit. <i>“Very well, student.”</i> She chuckles at that title. <i>“…Sit and listen carefully.”</i> \n\nYou sit next to her but keeping some distance, in case that you require moving your hands just like she does. <i>“The most important thing about the magic is…Will. Maybe some emotions can help you with some of the magics, but the will is the most important thing to a spellcaster. Without will, there is no magic. That is why my vengeance is a strong driving force for me, as it gives me willpower”</i> She twist her face a little bit, the memory of the source of her anger must be returning to her mind. <i>“But now you… and mother, are my driving force.”</i> She crosses her arms, as if the pardon for her mother is still on the way.\n\n<i>“With that being said, you must feel that the world around you is more like a tapestry that we spellcasters knit and unweave at will.”</i> She sits in front of you. <i>“Close your eyes and try to feel the world around you. Stop thinking about the city of the people in it for a minute. There is only you and your surroundings.”</i> \n\nYou close your eyes and try to focus on not focusing on anything. That is hard for sure, but you try your best to do it. <i>“This is meditation. It helps you to keep in touch with the reality and the threads that bind it together. When you can see the threads, you can start to understand them. It will take some time, but I’m sure that you will be able to do it.”</i> \n\nYou try to keep the concentration on your surroundings, as you stop hearing your sister Vivica and start feeling some kind of stream of energy flowing through the earth. Its as if a river flows below you slowly. After a while, you can feel your sister’s hand over your shoulder. <i>“Are you listening? You won’t learn anything if you keep dozing off in the middle of the meditation”</i> You shake your head and tell her that you wasn’t able to hear her voice as there is this strange flowing of something that made it hard for you to hear it. You open your eyes, only to see her dumbfounded at your words. <i>“How did you know that this place is reeking with magic flowings?”</i> You frown in confusion.\n\n<i>“This isn’t fair!”</i> She sputters as she looks a bit mad at you. <i>“How is that possible that you can see the threads in your first try? It took me days of meditation!”</i> She crosses her arms and turns her head. You smile, even as a spellcaster, she is still the Vivica that you know. You tell her that you only did what she told you to do, maybe its because of her teachings that you’re capable of learning quite fast. She turns to see you and nods. <i>“You’re right! Maybe I’m better than the old lady. That must be it.”</i> You can see that by the tone of her voice, she is telling it more to herself than to you.\n\nAfter that, she instructs you to try and hear the flow once more. You follow her instructions once more and reach that meditative state that you were before. The roaring of that flow is less deafening this time, but you can feel it around you. <i>“Try to make it flow through your body. Let yourself float in that flow of magic”</i> And with that, you relax your muscles and let yourself free inside that strange sensation. <i>“You’re truly gifted with the ability to learn magic. You’re not natural, you just learn fast. Interesting… Well, I wouldn’t expect less from a member of my family.”</i> \n\nAfter that, you open your eyes only to see your body glowing slightly, something that scares you for a second, as the magic vanishes in thin air. <i>“But you still lack understanding of the magic. But this tells me that you will reach far in this.”</i> She starts writing a couple of things in that book. You’re quite tired from all of that, so you tell her that perhaps you can continue later, as you need some rest. She nods at your commentary. <i>“You’re right. I almost forgot how hard it was for me at the start. Then we will continue on another time. Get some rest”</i> She says as she kisses your forehead for a second, just before you walk weary of the training, directly to your bedroom and fall like a log, sleeping in seconds.";

Now that you can sense the magic, its time for you to understand more about the differents schools of magic.”</i> You raise your eyebrows at the mention of schools. You didn’t know that magic was so organized. <i>“Well, at least that’s what the old lady’s book said about them. Maybe it was her own explanation, I’m not sure”</i> she shrugs but waves a hand, taking importance on the matter.\n\nYou can see that she has placed a table in her room, that seems to be comfortable enough for you two to sit and chat properly. She has a loafs of bread and some juices, probably waiting for you. <i>“Sit, this might take a while”</i> You sit on the chair that is closest to you, then you can see how she sits on the chair, but is floating slightly. You always wondered why she does that, so you ask her. <i>“Oh, this? It helps me to focus and when I’m tired, I just sit properly.”</i> \n\nShe takes out a book and points at an specific paragraph. <i>“The first school and my favorite is Destruction. Is wielding the most dangerous energies in the existence and controlling them with knowledge and willpower. From fire to thunder, from raw magic energy to intricate destructive spells”</i> She uses her other hand to lit a flame that is slowly floating above her palm, just before extinguishing it as she closes her hand. <i>“It helps that your will is backed with some strong concept, maybe your body or some passion.”</i> \n\nAfter that, she moves pages and points out at another paragraph in another page. <i>“Then there is the school of Persuasion. Is manipulating the emotions and thoughts of your enemy by force of will. Its strong and with this one, you’re capable of controlling the anger, fear or especially the libido of your opponent. ”</i> She lifts her hand for a second, before blinking and lowering her hand once more. <i>“…Perhaps you understand what it does. I don’t want… accidents.”</i> You think that feeling anger, fear or lust for your sister right now is something that is going to derail the whole training, and maybe cause some other things.\n\nThen she moves the pages until she stops in one. <i>“Then there is the school of Restoration. Is the school that requires most knowledge about things. It manipulates the mortal body and everything that happens in it, focusing on restoring the patterns that are damaged or out of perfection.”</i> She shows that there is a small burning on her hand, so she runs her hand over the wound and as the magic operates, the wound repairs after a couple of seconds. <i>“It helps to have knowledge of what you’re doing to do it faster.”</i> \n\nAfter that, she moves the pages with one hand until they stop at an specific page. <i>“Finally, there is the school of Entropy. Its one of the hardest to control, but also the most versatile if you ask me.”</i> She lifts her hand, as you can see that the place around Vivice starts to look dark, even though you can see that there is still light on the room. <i>“You force your will over the place around you, focusing on unweaving the magic around you. Depending on what you degrade and unweave is the effect desired.”</i> \n\nYou are quite surprised of how skilled in magic your sister is. After that, you continue talking about the magic until you feel tired. <i>“The next time we will start with your first spell. And as I am the teacher, I decide that you should learn Destruction first. I want you to be able to defend yourself as soon as possible, in case that I’m not around…”</i> You thank her for taking the time to teach you. <i>“You’re family. Of course that I will have time for you. Besides, this helps me to understand magic in better ways. Its a Win-Win situation. If only our uncle was alive to be… A PERFECT DUMMY FOR TESTING”</i> She cracks her knuckles after a bit, the magic in her surroundings starts to vibrate, but after a couple of seconds it stops. <i>“Sorry, I can get over the fact that I wasn’t here to see him fail…”</i> She smiles as if nothing had happened and waves you goodbye. You leave the place and think that in the end, you’ll be able to do that. And the feeling of impending power fills you with the will to continue training.";

Its still a bit weird that your little sister is teaching you about this, but you dismiss that feeling quickly, as the surge of power that you have acquired is enough for you to feel at ease with that fact. You think that the school of Destruction must be the reason why some people want to learn magic. You know that your sister has the knowledge, but you wonder if her lack of comprehension due to her lack of experience makes her vulnerable. You don’t know much about deals with other entities, but you’re sure that they must be like making deals with nobility: “If you don’t understand what you’re signing for, then you’re getting the short end of the stick.” You worry that your sister is being in the middle of some kind of entity supernatural fight, and you too by extension.\n\nYour sister is awaiting impatiently your arrival at the training ground that you improvised at the garden behind your castle. The servants hurry back as they leave the place ready for whatever your sister has in store for you. <i>“You’re late.”</i> You frown a bit, as you say that you’re on time for sure, its probably because that she was too early. <i>“You’re late for someone that is going to learn their first magic spell!”</i> The explains then sighs. <i>“Well, now that you’re here. Its time for you to wield the magic for the first time. ”</i> \n\nShe cleans her throat a couple of times. <i>“I didn’t chose Destruction only because its my favorite school. Well, maybe yes”</i> You can see for a second, a devilish grin on her face. <i>“But also because its the easiest school to teach. You don’t need to transform the magic or alter it in some way. You just need to exert your will over the concept and fuel it with your magic energy.”</i> She rubs her chin for a second as she starts flying. Now that you understand why she does it, it all makes sense now. <i>“It may sound hard, but it isn’t. Let’s start with something easy. After all, in combat you cannot enter a meditative state. You must be able to wield the magic in an instant”</i> \n\nShe points at your hand. <i>“Think about the qualities of fire. Its warmth, what you think when you hear the word fire. All its meanings. And with that, I want you to focus on your hand and visualize a small flame growing in it.”</i> You think that it sounds a bit complicated, but you’ve been training whenever you can, so you think that you get the hang of it. And so, you start following her instructions. Thinking about all the times that you’ve seen fire. From your dreams full of fire to the small campfires that your guardian taught you how to do. After a while, you hear your sister’s voice filled with satisfaction. <i>“Someone has been training while its away.”</i>\n\nYou open your eyes and see that there is a small flame in your hand. You can see the flowing of magic towards your palm and how it fuels the fire that its floating above your hand. You can see that your sister takes a closer look at your flame. <i>“It looks slightly different from mine. As if your concept of fire is slightly different than mine. So that’s what the book meant…”</i> She claps her hands several times, as you can see that she is excited to see your progress. <i>“Again! Do it again! Throw it to that wood dummy!”</i> You stop fueling the fire, so it dies out. After that, you concentrate once more and see how the flame starts to grew once more. Now you don’t need to close your eyes to do it. You throw it to the dummy and see it catch fire, as you can see the eyes of your sister glowing with malicious glee as the fire consumes the wood.\n\nAfter a while, you feel exhausted until you can do it no more. <i>“Whoa! You learn quite fast. You just need to keep practicing and it will be like breathing after a while. You’ve earned a rest”</i> She says excited as you can barely held your arms. She gives you a hug that you can’t refuse, then you slowly walk back to your room.\n\nYou learned the spell “Harm”. <b>Not implemented yet.</b> ";

You wonder how hard it can be to tamper with the mind of another. Its sound quite useful but somehow deep inside you, the sensation of dread about it is quite surprising. You can only think about the dangers of using the magic in the other members of the noble houses and worry that if you somehow got it wrong, you can lose all the progress that you’ve achieved until now. Maybe telling other people in public that you will be capable of such feats of magic must be something that you should do ultimately.\n\nAs you arrive, your sister Vivica is sitting close to you in one of the hallways of the castle that leads to the garden. In there, she is waiting for you with a small rabbit inside a iron cage. She turns to see you as she stands up and cleans herself a bit from dust. <i>“You’re early, "+ mcpronoun1 +". Excited about learning the school of persuasion?”</i> You nod at the irony of her words. She leans her head for a second, probably confused from your expression. <i>“Riiiiiight. The school of Persuasion is a bit more complicated than Destruction. In Destruction, you only control the energies that already exist and create them. In Persuasion, you must use your magic prowess to twist, ignite or dampen the concepts of thoughts and emotions inside the mind of your target. This is improved by your capacity at manipulating emotions on a normal basis, because you know how they work and you only need to focus your magic in doing those things. You shouldn’t say this to anyone, but this is one of the hardest magic schools for me. I just usually don’t care about others emotions”</i> She crosses her arms and looks away for a second. You think that the real reason is because she is bad at reading other people’s intentions. You think that all the time that you’ve dealing with other people as a Liege, can help you with that.\n\nShe points at the small animal that she has caged close to her. <i>“Doing it to animals is easier, so you’ll start with this little fella. Since the plague, the easiest mindset that you can apply is lust. I think that the magic has been tainted a bit by the resonance of the cities. Not sure.”</i> She points at the cage. <i>“Now, you must know the state of your opponent’s mind. The bunny is relaxed, so it should be easier for you”</i> When you turn to see the little rabbit, you can see that is pressed against the corner of the room that is as far as it can from your sister, and you can see its nose twitching. You think that the bunny is scared, more than relaxed. <i>“You only need to focus your magic on the subject and try to coerce into a state of lust.”</i> \n\nYou concentrate a bit as you can feel your magic skill flowing easier and easier for you. You know that the rabbit is scared, but you’re sure that you can make it focus on its own lust. At first you think of ways to turn on a rabbit, but that sounds stupid rather quickly. You think that perhaps you can force him into a state of lust-haze. So, you focus your magic and shoot it at the cage, but you see that the spell slings farther from the cage and trembles into the whole room. You can see how the spell hits…";

You wonder if the School of Restoration is as you think that it is. The only reference that you can think of about restoring people is the alchemy. You wonder if its somehow similar. Perhaps the magic spawned the alchemy when it was lacking? Or maybe the alchemy its the magic for those that aren’t able to cast magic? Surely this school is one of the most interesting since it has to do that is still being used until today.\n\nYou arrive at the house of healing, where she is waiting for you as she is inspecting the place. There were a lot of improvised stretchers, as it seems that there was a battle recently. You arrive with Vivica and ask what happened. <i>“Oh, this? Well, it was one patrol that got caught by a small pack of Losts, outside of the city. Don’t worry, there wasn’t even one dead.”</i> You smile and frown at her lack of empathy with others that aren’t family, she is surely your sister. <i>“They are magically asleep, so we don’t have to worry.”</i> You go and inspect some of them as she is speaking. You can swear that some of them has the same hit on their heads, as if beaten with a heavy blunt object. <i>“…but some of them resisted the magical spell. They were worried thati would eat them. You know, the demon look and all those things”</i> She crossed her arms.\n\n<i>“Anyway… The School of Restoration. Its the hardest at first, but when you got the hang of it, you can do it with ease”</i> She floats over some of the wounded and motions you to get closer to one of them. There is a fresh wound in there, half-clotted. It has been a while since you have to see such kind of wound, the last times that you saw something like this was when your Guardian returned wounded from the fights with the creatures outside the cabin in the woods. <i>“Restoration is the School of repair and healing. You must know how it looks the original tissue that you’re about to heal, because it will fail if you don’t understand how is the correct way of the part that you’re healing. You need to focus your magic prowess on the part that you’re planning on healing. The first spell focuses on restoring small wounds that only bleed, so it won’t be that useful on diseases of the like. The book of the old hag has only so much knowledge about this school”</i> She points around the wound. <i>“Think of how this part should look like and then let the magic flow and infuse it.”</i> \n\nYou start to focus your magic on your hand, which is now something that you can do reflexively. It took you several training days, but now it works as intended. You hover your hand over the guard’s wound and start thinking on that part of its body, completely healed. You can feel how your magic struggles with that thought, so you start thinking on the same part of its body, but now with a small scar. When you think about it, the magic flows easier. <i>“Nice use of your magic. I’m getting used that you’re able to do it on one of your first tries. I talked with mom, and she says that she always saw something about you that was always off. But unlike me, your capacities aren’t as destructive as mine”</i> You thought that she would say it with a hint of pessimism, but she says it proudly.\n\nYou open your eyes, as you can see that the wound is closed, but its still bloody. <i>“Knowledge. That’s important on this School. The more you use it and see wounds, the more you’ll understand of this one. Its hard for me as I barely have any wounds when I fight. I just need to hurl death at my enemies.”</i> She laughs, as the tone of her laugh is quite sinister. You ask how is doing things with mother. You know things have been tense since she returned. <i>“Hey, we just talked a bit about you.”</i> She crosses her arms and looks at another soldier, but you know that she is just avoiding your gaze. <i>“And we made somehow a truce for the moment. You need all the help you can get. After that we can return to hate each other as always.”</i> You sigh, she is as childish as ever with her grudge against your mother. \n\nYou continued practicing with other soldiers, after a while you finally feel tired and decide to leave the training for the day. <i>“Yeah, this is why healing isn’t that useful on a daily basis of healing. We have a limit on the day and we can’t waste it on keeping people alive. If we annihilate the source of harm, then everything will be alright at the end. The class is over for now! I’m hungry!”</i> Your sister says before floating slowly through the entrance of the house of healing. You think that perhaps you should talk with the one in charge of the healing house, when its available. Perhaps it knows more of what is happening outside the city. You leave the place as you feel quite tired, so you can rest like the log you always feel like, in your bed.";

Now that you understand three of the four Schools of Magic that your sister Vivica told you, your perception of the world has been broadened by a large amount of space. You’ve been studying a bit about the body in the dusty books of the library, tried your magic of persuasion on some other animals… and persons a couple of times, and destroyed a couple of dummies on the garden. Now you feel reassured that you’ll be able to learn about the School of Entropy… whatever that means. The word itself is quite hard to understand.\n\nYou arrive at the second floor of the castle, in a place that has a great sight of the garden that is below it. You can see that Vivica is already casting magic from what you can see. She is enjoying a lot of what she is doing, so you got close to her and see what she is doing. There are a couple of servants on the floor below and she is laughing at how they fall into the floor or hit walls. She notices that you’re there and turns to see you. <i>“"+ mcpronoun1 +"! Good to see you here!”</i> You ask her what she is doing. <i>“Oh, this? I’m having some good old fun with the servants of the castle”</i> It seems that she is using magic of some sorts to make them clumsy.\n\n<i>“This is the instant effects of the School of Entropy”</i> She turns to see you before looking back at the servants that are below them. <i>“With this School, you’re able to affect your surroundings, by making the reality ”fail” in one of the senses of the word. The easiest spell of this School plays with the first effects of dampening the magic around your target. You must be able to use your magic prowess to disrupt the flow of light around your target. This will cause the perception of your to blur. It helps me to hinder its sight and make him fail more of his attacks. And as you know, I fly so the things that focus in pointing at things that fly are my biggest problem”</i> She hovers just a bit to make her point more valid.\n\n<i>“You just need to focus on the space surrounding your objective. When you got it, you just need to force its decay. Its a bit hard at first, but you can get the hang of it. The test subjects are your servants. You need to focus with your eyes open. This isn’t some apprentice-level of focus. You should be able to focus with your eyes.”</i> And with that, you can feel the magic surge flowing through your surroundings as your body starts charging its own supply of magic. You focus on one of the servants that is walking through the garden, as you can see how he blurs a bit after your spell reach him. He stops walking and rubs his eyes as he tries to walk slowly towards one wall, but falls flat into a small step and hits its face into the ground. You can hear how your sister starts laughing at the sight. <i>“That’s it! Nicely done! Do it again!”</i> \n\nAfter that, you can see that they were a couple of servants sparring between themselves as other of them is carrying a big bulk of clean clothings, probably washed.

			Board.text = "After the last time that you’ve been with Vivica, you thought that you have learned the basics of magic. You are wondering that since you know them, she is going to teach you some kind of advanced magic. Maybe she’ll finally teach you how to float just like she does, as it looks quite handy for her, even thought you think that its because she is small and she requires the extra reach, but you can think a couple of additional functions besides that one. You knock the door a couple of times, hearing her voice from inside. <i>“Come in, "+GameControl.playerName+". I’m in the middle of something”</i> \n\nYou open the door slowly, as you notice that there is a spear on the floor. Your sister is hovering over it in her own magical way, inspecting from tio to base. You can feel a small flow of magic coming from that weapon. You approach it as she turns to see you, floats in your direction and hugs you from the side. <i>“Its good to see you. How did the “ghost of the castle” went?”</i>  You tell her that you took your time on convincing them that it was only a trick of the mind, and that you’ll talk with your mother about the situation, something that didn’t happened as you know the real reason of the supernatural event. After you finished explaining the situation, you can see that your sister starts laughing quite loudly. <i>“Hahahaha. Oh dear, its so fun to use the superstition of the common person. ”</i> You can’t help but smile at her, now that you know how the magic works, you can see how different are the beliefs of the common citizen about it. Damn, you thought a bit like them just before your sister helped you understand more about how the magic works.\n\nBut you dismiss the subject and ask her what she is doing right now. <i>“Well, I was… You know, this is a good time for you to understand more about the “artifacts” and how they work.”</i> ¿Artifacts? Sounds quite important, but you haven’t heard about them. <i>“Well, its maybe because other mages must be calling them by different names. That’s the problem that there isn’t a proper magic school up close, everyone is taking steps in the comprehension on magic and everyone is eager to use their own names to explain everything, but for now I will call them Artifacts, because that’s how they are called in the book of the old lady..”</i> You nod, seems fair enough for you. <i>“The higher levels of magic can’t be taught, because they are created when the mage comprehends the concept of the spell that he is trying to replicate. The first spell is just opening the magic spark in the mind of the spellcaster. It isn’t that hard, or at least that’s what I think it is. After all, my spellcasting ability is being borrowed and amplified bby the pact I made in the first place”</i> Oh yeah, the pact. Now that you have some knowledge of magic, maybe its time for you to search more on the subject.\n\nShe floats back to the spear that is close to both of you and points at it. <i>“This spear for example, is an artifact”</i> You tell her that you felt a bit of magic in it and wonder if its because its an artifact, but she crosses her arms and sighs. <i>“Its harder than that. That magic is my doing, as I’m trying to understand its origin, as somehow its related to my abyssal master. An artifact is something that is related to a spell in concept or form. Anything can be an artifact if it helps you to shape your perception and expand your mind in one of the schools of magic. For example, I understood the concept of floating through a big feather of an harpy”</i> You ask her if that’s the case, then why she doesn’t have an spell of every thing around her.\n\nWhen you say that, she turns and gives you a killing stare. <i>“Magic isn’t a joke. If you want to spend weeks on trying to weave a spell on how to Persuade Chairs, be my guest. But I won’t help you on such weird tasks. The object in question must truly resonate with the school in question and more specific, help you comprehend the concept of the spell that you’re trying to accomplish. I’m pretty sure that you will find some of them in your travels. If you bring it to me, I’m sure that I’ll be able to help you to with it, but in the end, the spell sculpting is only yours”</i> You nod after that. It seems that learning magic is going to become something more harder than you thought. But oh well, it has been easy for the first spell of each school, so you can’t really complaint. At least now you have something to keep an eye for, when you’re traveling to other cities. <i>“I’ll keep my studies in this place. The tower brings me back bad memories and I don’t want anyone else to disturb me on my magical experiments”</i> You tell her that’s fine, as long as she doesn’t use any of the servants on an experiment that is permanent. <i>“Oh don’t worry. I won’t maim any of your precious little toys, brother. I promise I’ll put them back when I’m finished with them and you won’t even notice that I did it”</i> She gives you a wink as if she was talking about a chest full of toys and not sentient beings. You wonder for a second how much of her behavior is because of the pact that she made and how much is her real self. But that’s the point of the corruption, isn’t it?\n\nYou can see that after saying that, she returns to see the spear that is laying on the floor. You place a knee on it, as both of you inspect it as she is probably trying to understand what it could mean but to no avail. After a couple of hours, you tell her that you have to leave. <i>“Sure, "+ mcpronoun1 +". You have things to do and so do I. Its nice to see you again. Don’t forget to visit again”</i> And with that, you leave her to investigate further about the weapon that is related to her soul pact or whatever pact she did with the entity. Is she searching for it once more? It would be troublesome if she summons it in the middle of the castle to destroy or something like that. You’ve been working hard on repairing the place. Is she trying to break herself free or to dig herself some more in these demonic powers? Only time will tell, but you don’t have that kind of time…";

You need to know the kind of pact that she did but your sister has been avoiding the subject for a while, not explaining in detail about it. So this time, you will try and get it from the source.\n\nOne night, you sneaked into your sister’s room, trying to find the spear that she was investigating the last time you visited her. Now that you know that its somehow related to that entity, you’re sure that you can use it to connect with it somehow, as some kind of artifact. You hope that it doesn’t take too long, as you’re sure that your sister will notice if the spear moves from place to place every night. You even wonder how something so important for her wasn’t protected by some kind of spell. But you didn’t have enough time to ponder in all those questions, as the lack of sunlight is limited and you don’t know how long it will take the ritual.\n\nYou move into the dungeon, as you don’t want to be bothered or that thing creating more fuss than needed. You get ready for anything, focusing on the spells that you already have. You don’t think that you’ll be able to contact that entity, but its never bad to be a bit cautious. At least as cautious as you can be by trying to contact something that you don’t fully understand. But you think that you don’t have that much time before that thing does something that could get your city in danger. After all, she probably told it why she wanted the power and that will be troublesome.\n\nWith that in mind, you closed your eyes, trying to understand how this weapon could be used by that powerful creature. At first, you thought that you heard something that was causing the magic to tremble, but you found out it was nothing of importance, more like a normal disturbance in the flowing of magic. At first, you tried and tried but nothing come out of it, it was completely closed. A heavy voice slipped through your surroundings, echoing across the whole room as if it came from all over the place. You opened your eyes while you tried to pinpoint the origin of it but with no avail. <i>“I know who you are. I know what you’re capable of…”</i> Its quite worrying to be unable to see the one that is referring to you.\n\n<i>“I know that you’ve seen her. The horned girl, she is quite powerful now, don’t you think? Maybe she isn’t grown on size, but that’s what makes her dangerous. No one expects someone as her to be able to set a castle ablaze…”</i> You demand its name as you focus some of your magic on your hand. You can even feel how its voice changes from one of amusement to one of surprise. <i>“Oh, I see that you’ve made yourself open to the magic! Too bad. I would had shown you a whole new paradigm of magic for you. Towns being set ablaze at your feet. The Citadel burning, fueled by the hatred of the other cities. Their vengeance fulfilled.”</i> You cross your arms and tell him that if there will be retribution or vengeance, it will be in your terms and not on theirs. You know damn well that these kind of words coming from someone capable of such things are never good for the executor on the long term.\n\n<i>“Well, well, well… You have some brains on that head of yours. Or is it pride, perhaps? Doesn’t matter, you’re not the kind to be tempted with petty things. And if you’re not that kind of person, then what the hell are you doing here, searching for me?”</i> You stand your ground and tell her that you’re there because you want to know what is the deal that it has with Vivica. <i>“Vivica? I do not care for names, as their souls are more important to me… But your soul, is somewhat similar to that girl from a while ago. You must be talking about one of my Anchors.”</i> You remember what she told you about that. Something about as long as she is what she is now, that thing will roam the world free and unrestrained. <i>“Why I should reveal something as important to someone like you? Because you asked me to do it?”</i> The voice laughs strong, its sound almost deafening you. <i>“Are you really that naive? Or its because you’re so entitled because you know some apprentice-level spells? You’re lucky I’m not at your location at the moment, but the spear is there…”</i> And with that, you can hear the air moving around you. As you turn to see, the spear is floating, its sharp head pointing in your direction. <i>“Your will is strong, but let’s not put your flesh to the test. Why are you here?”</i>\n\nAnd with that, you wonder what you really want from that conversation. Do you want to help her to return to her former self? Or do you want her to drive further into the form that she has now?";

You flatter yourself a bit, my dear "+ mcpronoun1 +". But I’ll give you one chance, maybe you found something new on your travels to the court.”</i> She giggles.

I get it, but at least you should have warned me! I could’ve went with you and protect you if something went wrong.”</i> But you tell her that when you’re on the field, nothing can go wrong, just like that. But, you tell her that you found out some interesting things on that educational trip you did with that unknown entity. <i>“Yeah? Like what?.”</i> Well, like the fact that its planning to ask her to do something against you or your mother, but you can see that she mocks that though with a face gesture. <i>“Oh, come on.

But maybe now that I have you to help me with that, perhaps I can do it this time.”</i> You tell her that’s what you wanted to hear. Its time for you two to investigate in the old books of the library, to find a magical way of binding that creature yo her will. <i>“That would be awesome!

But this time, we’ll do this like a family: Together”</i> And you agree with that. <i>“"+GameControl.playerName+", do you still have that spear?”</i> To which you nod, so she turns and looks at Vivica. <i>“I’m sorry that I have to put you through this, but I will require that you get ready, because your force of will is going to be put to the test.”</i>  Both you and her were a bit confused from her statement, something she notices so she will continue. <i>“This creature will try and posess you, Vivica. That’s its goal. But it doesn’t take into account that you will be ready for it. I will be there”</i> You interrupt her, saying that you’re also planning on being there.\n\nYour sister looks a bit insecure for the first time in your life. <i>“…Sure. Its time to recover my future, as a family”</i> You can relax your muscles a bit, everything worked just fine. You hope that the thing that your mother has planned also work as she think is gonna work. After a family moment, all of you promise to get ready for the next time you gather. Your mother follows Vivica quite closely, as she isn’t bothered by her anymore. Surely they have a lot of things to talk and you feel that you’re going to intervene in that if you stay, so you decide to leave them on their own. They’ve earned it.";

It took you long enough, but after a time of investigating, you think that you finally found out what is that thing.\n\n<i>“Its not a true demon, but its someone that somehow got its powers from the Deities of Old, just like the cultists. It strikes bargains and deals with mortals to spread its influence by using their Anchors like tools fo- Oh, that bastard!.”</i> She spouts angrily as she places the book down into the table, pushing aside a lot of other books into the floor. <i>“That thing used me!”</i> You take the book as she waves her hands into the air and took a good look at your sister. She was so naive to think that think was making some kind of good gesture? Perhaps you were born on the morning, but not that morning. Thank goodness that you’re there now, or she would be on the path of destruction that thing wanted for her. You keep reading while she keeps her tantrum by punching some bookshelves and kicking some books, until you found a ritual that its inscribed in the pages of that book that could be used to remove the power of that person —because you know now that its a person— and transfer it to one of its debts.\n\nYou tell your sister to stop arguing with inanimate objects, because you know they will win against her. <i>“Har, har, har. What did you found?”</i>  So you explain it to her, something that makes her recover her composure once more. <i>“Its time for payback, you stupid thing.”</i> She musters with glee as both of you read the book. It seems that the ritual is separated into two different paths, depending on what the caster want to do with the other ensorcelled person. In one of the rituals, you can see that the entity is consumed entirely, putting an end to a dangerous adversary. But on the other hand, the other type of ritual, strips it of its powers and leaves its body quite weak to resist the caster.\n\nYour sister is a bit puzzled with those two rituals. <i>“I would prefer to smother it out of existence, but maybe I’m not seeing something important.

You have seen them both enjoying meals together, taking a walk on their own, Vivica has even showed her the new capabilities that the magic has bestowed upon her. Since then, you’ve been preparing for the final round with that thing, even though you’re not sure how its gonna be as your mother is hazy at best with her explanations. She has been too busy on the last days to dedicate enough time for you to understand. Perhaps she feels that there is so much at stake, and you can’t deny that too. If you thought that the magic is metaphysical enough, now there is this “soul” thing that is farther from what you thought that you understood about reality. But that isn’t going to stop you from trying.\n\nThen, one day sooner than you thought, your mother said that everything is ready and there isn’t much time to waste. She tells you to bring the spear to the cave where she used to do the pact with that entity. This type of thing must be kept outside the eyes of the inquisitors of the city or your family will be in trouble, even when you’re trying to deal with this thing. You know that you can’t risk your position so early in your rightful rising to power. When you arrive, you can see that your mother is looking around the cave, making sure that no one is around. You told that you wanted to do some memorial for your dead father, so you would take a couple of hours in the outskirts of the city.\n\nThe place is quite big, as it seems that your thought of the cave where your sister resided for a while was different than you thought. You can see that Vivica is floating closer to your back, looking around quite worried about the upcoming trial for her. So you place the spear in the middle of the damp cave, as you get ready to channel your magic through it just like you did it last time. You try to focus your magical sense on the object as you await for something to happen, but this time is completely different. This time you can feel that powerful presence getting closer to your location, using the spear as some kind of component for some transportation spell. You only have enough time to move away from the spear, as you can see how it envelops itself in powerful magic. From it, you can see that there is a small portal opening up in thin air from where a creature got out covered in black robes, a couple of horns protrude from its hood and a pair of membranous wings unfold. <i>“Its good to see how you’ve complied to her true side. Have you come in here to finish your transformation, spellcaster?”</i> The horned creature says out loud, its gruesome voice almost made the walls tremble.\n\nVivica stands in front of that creature, as you move close to her. Your mother in her symbiote skin moves closer too. <i>“We’ve come to free myself from the bargain that you tricked me into!”</i> She says out loud, but the entity frown. <i>“I didn’t forced you into anything, girl. You’re the only one to blame in all of this. You wanted power and now you want to give it back? I expected more from someone with an enormous desire of vengeance as you were. Its not my fault that the target of your vengeance died before you could enact it. Blame the plague, blame the one who killed it, blame yourself for not getting in time.”</i>  \n\nYour mother takes a step into it. <i>“You treacherous fiend! You take advantage of vulnerable people! We are not going to be fooled by your silver tongue. We have come to reclaim the soul of one of our family. This will not stand!”</i> But that creature raised its hand, as Vivica grunts in pain as it holds her own chest. <i>“What are you gonna do? You’re such weaklings compared to me!”</i> You prepare one of your Destruction spells and sling it against the creature. The shock of energy impacted on the side of your enemy, showing that it was some kind of horned woman. She just threw a bolt of lightning from one of her hands against you, as you tried to evate it but it was hard, hurting you in the process.  <i>“That’s all you’ve got?”</i> But you knew from the start that it wouldn’t be enough. You only see something hitting the side of that female creature, that causes her to writhe in pain, as your mother stands her ground and kneels as she presses her arms against her own body in meditation. What seemed to be a purification elixir is starting to cause her presence to dwindle more and more.  <i>“Its a gift from the high priest!”</i> And with that, both you and Vivica start to attack with your magic and combat prowess to her, forcing her to stand back.\n\n<i>“THIS IS NOT OVER! I WILL HAVE YOU, BE IT WILLINGLY OR BY FORCE!”</i> You can hear an impure scream coming out from the throat of that female, as her figure slowly transmute itself into shadows and darts against Vivica, as one of the spells pass through her as if she were smoke. You only have a second to react to this situation. You can force your way to protect Vivica, but who knows what will happen. Or you can leave her to deal with that entity, as your mother said that must be done.";

You have seen that Vivica is a little bit less frustrated, as having something to focus is helping her to cope with that.\n\nAnd so, both of you return to the cave where she said that she made the original pact. It took you long enough of roaming through the zone as she couldn’t quite recall the place perfectly, but in the end you found out the cave, which is covered in moss and more humid than you expected.

Your mother seemed reticent at first, but the alchemist convinced her, but you are not sure how. <i>“I did learned everything she threw at me. I tried my best to learn everything she had in the books she brought with her as I learned a lot from her in the field of alchemy. Even the old one was impressed with how quickly I was able to learn and apply my own thoughts into the recipes.”</i>\n\nYou feel your sister tense up a bit as she continues on, <i>“But with all good things, couldn’t last forever.  You remember that fateful night when mom came into the tower and hurried us to leave the city with her. It was the night that our uncle attacked father. We left the tower through a secret passage and at the city walls. I wondered why our mother was with us and not with father, as I was worried that you were with him at the time. I was worried to death that you could get caught too, because I would be all alone.”</i> Vivica clenches her fist but still goes on, <i>“We ran through the forest on a horse as far as we could, and before I could realize what happened, I was in a cave far away from the city.  I was furious. I argued with the old one for hours until she told me that if I returned to the city, I would get killed.

I’m pretty sure that it was a powerful spirit of some sorts, or a demon”</i> she says, thinking about it. A deal with an unknown entity? Those things never end well. One usually ends fucked in every sense of the word. But that a demon bestows magic? That’s unheard of. <i>“It seemed versed in the art of magic. He said to be a creature as old as the island itself, but I couldn’t see its face, as it was covered in a black robe of some sorts. It said that it could help me to learn magic. ”</i>\n\nYou ask her a bit preoccupied that if she accepted its bargain, to which she looks quite puzzled at your tone of voice. <i>“I did.

As long as I have this power, its fine for me that the demon roams free through these lands”</i> she shrugs after that. You can see that your sister only wants power and doesn’t care how she gets it.

I can take care of that, I’ve been doing it for quite a while. So rest assured that the entity is away from here. I would never risk your safety.”</i> She smiles at your affection for her.

You stride and use your back to cover her from that desperate move from the horned female, its shadowy influence crawling through your back and into your body. The fear in your sister’s eyes is apparent when she realizes what you’ve just done.\n\nYou stagger back a couple of steps just before you hear your mind being plagued by the strident voice of that creature, seeping through your head as a poison that risks your very perception of reality. <i>“What do we have here?… A Liege? Oh my. Think of all the wonderful things that I could achieve with this body! Screw that girl, you’re the real deal now.”</i> You fight back with all your will as it tries to control your muscles, trying to exert its corrupting will against your very soul. You place your back against a wall, as both of your relatives get closer to you and scream a couple of things to you, but its hard to hear them over the loud voice of that female. <i>“The Mother of All will be pleased with this sacrifice…”</i> You grab your head as your mother seems to be chanting while your sister casts spells that you don’t understand.\n\nWhatever is doing your mother, it sears like a thousand suns inside your body, as if something is writhing inside you in pain from it. The magic that your sister is doing, probably is the reason that you’re not dying from it. You can see that the creature is trying to get a hold of your mind, but you lunge at her in your mind, exerting your will to push her back outside your mind just before you can see a black light coursing from your body and forming a ball of shadows as you slide into the floor. Your mother stands and throws the ball at the spear. <i>“I SEAL YOU WITHIN THE SPEAR FROM WHENCE YOU CAME, CORRUPTOR!”</i> You can finally hear the voice of your mother, as it seems to be casting it into the spear, as a horrid scream echoes through the whole place before everything went into silence, as you can see from the corner of your eye how the spear wallows on the floor.\n\n<i>“Why you did that?!”</i> That’s what you heard from close, just before being hit in the face with a palm several times. You can see that your sister is there, almost tearing herself away. <i>“You weren’t ready! Are you mad?!”</i> You doesn’t stop her from slapping you, probably you deserve that as you didn’t followed suit as you were supposed to do it. You tell her that its your duty as an older "+ mcpronoun1 +", to take care of its younger sister. She places her face on your chest, sobbing a bit from the chance that you became the vessel of some corrupting entity from the past. Your mother seems to be busy dealing with the spear.\n\nAfter a couple of minutes, you stand slowly being helped by your sister as your mother returns to both of you and helds the spear in her hand. <i>“I will bring this to the temple. I’ll tell them that I found it on the cave and that it needs a place to be stored safely. Let us hope that there isn’t another plague to wake it once more. How do you feel, my child?”</i> She says as you stand and tell her that you just feel relieved that you aren’t allergic to old forces of corruption. With a smile, you can see that your sister has changed. Her skin has changed, now looks more like her mother’s… and her horns were gone. But her tail and wings were still there. Probably the influence is rooted so deep that some of the changes are permanent. Well, at least she is free from its influence and that is what matters.  ";

And with that, you can see that she is tackled by the wail of shadows, forcing her into a wall of the cave. You can see that at the start of everything she seems to be fighting the creature that is trying to take control of her body. You don’t know what else to do, so you only held her in your arms as she thrashes and screams in pain, probably tring to contain that thing in her body. You can see that her back is glowing, probably helping her to control that thing. <i>“I won’t let that Mother of All do whatever it wants with my body!”</i> She yells as she keeps containing it. You can see your mother doing some kind of ritual next to your sister.\n\nWhatever is doing your mother, it sears like a thousand suns as it leaves marks over your sister’s body, as if something is writhing inside her in pain from it. You start to use the Restoration school, in hope that it helps her in any way you can. You can see a black light coursing from her body and forming a ball of shadows as she slide into the floor and off your arms.

I thought I was gonna be consumed by that thing”</i> And with that she hugs you firmly. <i>“I was scared! But I could feel your hands all over me. That’s what gave me strength!”</i> She said that its good that at least you could be able to help her in that predicament.

How many time will be before it finds a way to escape and enact its vengeance upon you. No, you won’t leave a loose thread, its time to clean the slate and start anew. Its not that I will miss it, neither she if you adventure to say it. <i>“Yeah. Its better for me that way, as I want my vengeance upon it. Because the thought of hurting you because of its influencing and corrupting powers is making my blood boil with anger”</i> \n\nBesides, its time for her to show you that she is capable of doing anything to gain power. Even destroying another creature, even if its someone that its capable of manipulating. <i>“Well… I haven’t thought about it before. I usually destroy property, but this would be the first person that I would force to cease to exist. Who could have thought that forcing someone into servitude would be something kinder than anything else.”</i> But you shake your head, you cannot let anyone to stand in her path to greatness. When she hears your voice, her voice loses its doubt tone.  <i>“You’re right. The power is the language of the strong. And I will be stronger than anyone else!”</i> She clenches her fists. <i>“And I will help you rule this city with an iron fist if that is what is needed to restore the greatness of our bloodline. Thank you for reminding me that.”</i> You tell her that’s why she is your sister, because she has the potential to become the strongest spellcaster because she isn’t afraid of taking the risks. And that she doesn’t have to worry, as she has you by your side.\n\n<i>“Thank you. You don’t know how much I’ve missed you since we were separated. But now nothing will stand between us again.”</i> Her fists caught fire. <i>“And that’s a promise from your sister”</i> You tell her that you love that gesture, but she will burn the library down with both of you inside.

You know that its a pretty way of saying that you’ll enslave someone and make it suffer, but it has earned it. For how many long it hasn’t destroyed the lives of the ones that binds into its pacts? Maybe even your uncle was one of them, as it isn’t that strange to think that your uncle was someone that brought ruin into the city of Aurorum. She has to pay, and death is something quick and easy for her to escape for.\n\nYour sister is surprised with your response. <i>“Whoa. I thought that I was being nice in thinking about leaving her alive, but how do you put it, I think that it will be better to keep her in chains for a while. And that’s why you’re the older "+ mcpronoun1 +".”</i> You nod. You surprise yourself from time to time with your way of thinking. Surely you’ve changed a lot since you are the Liege of this city. You also tell her that she isn’t a murderer and that despite her hunger for power, she must restrain from taking mortal lives carelessly. They may be weak but some of them can be stronger and can be useful to you in the long term. She should not squash the ones that comply to your demands and are promising students, but she must make sure that the ones that oppose you feel the wrath of your family. <i>“I like that. I’m being generous but also I will not be displayed as a weakling. You sure are a strong leader, my "+ mcpronoun1 +". But leave the dissenters to me, then.”</i> \n\nYou shrug and nod. Of course that she has a very important place on that city of dreams that you have planned. In fact, your mother also is into it and she should start making some kind of truce with her if she wants to be of truly great use to you. She crosses her arms for a second. <i>“I will, I will. But not today, as we have better things to do.”</i> To which you nod, she is right. And with that being settled, both of you start to get the ritual studied enough for both of you to use it.";
