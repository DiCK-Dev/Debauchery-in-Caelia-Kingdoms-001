As to my request, they close the library to keep the place private for me and Virgil. The truth is, I don’t want that old lady to interrupt us, and I hate to lean forward just to be able to hear what the young wallaby has to say.\n\nHe opens the door at the exact time I reach his office.\n\nHe bows at me <i>“W-welcome my Liege...”</i> he tries to say something else, but he is so nervous I can’t really heard what he said. I tell him to speak up and he stands up again, his whole body stiff with fear. <i>“S-Sorry! I meant to say I hope you are ready for your first lesson!... P-please, follow me.”</i>\n\nHe changed his office into a small classroom, which is pretty considerate of him. There is a big black board, a table with a couple of seats, a globe... Actually, this place looks like is decorated for kids, and I have to ask about that <i>“F-For kids? No! No eh... I... This is how I picture a classroom, no disrespect my Liege! I will change it! I’m sorry!”</i> Whatever, you tell him, you don't come here to appreciate the decoration. He sighs in relief and walks towards the board.\n\n<i>“I... Where I could start...”</i> He is distracted by something, out of focus. After of couple of minutes, you realize that from time to time he turns around to look at you. And not only your face, but your body too, is he... Interested in it? Finally you just ask him what is going on <i>“W-what? Nothing my Liege! My apologies! It is just that I am not sure what would be the best thing to teach you.”</i> You wait until he turns again, but this time you make eye contact. He turns around, all red, pretending nothing did happen. \n\nWhat should you do? This will change your future interactions with him.

It won’t matter if you give him the finest suit in the city, and the best beauty treatment, if he is unable to speak and behave properly, it will be impossible for him to find out someone interested in him. Well, you could just <i>pay</i>, but that’s not as reliable and it may not even help him in the long run emotionally. \n\nYou invite him to your castle. There, you can see that he is more nervous than the last time. You ask if everything is fine <i>“Yes yes... It’s just, I am so used to be safe in my library and this place... Is similar, and yet so different.”</i> You shrug, since at this point you are getting used to the place. You ask him if he knows how it feels to be a "+lordlady+", or even just a boss, someone with power. He shakes his head <i>“No I’ve... Never had that chance, and Celia always treats me like a s... Bad.”</i> Well, she looks harsh, but his attitude doesn’t help. \n\nThere is no easy way to build confidence on someone that doesn’t believes in himself, or that’s under the command of someone too dominant, but you decide to give him a hand. You explain that you will provide him with an honorary title, nothing big, but enough that he has to be respected by the commoners in the city, and that he’ll have a retainer under his command. He is too impressed at first to even answer, and still with a face of disbelief he addresses the issue. <i>“Is this... for real my Liege? Why... Why would you do that? I am a useless mess!”</i> You shake your head. Sure, he is a useless mess right now, but you know he has potential, and you require his knowledge. Now as a teacher, but in the future, as your loyal retainer too. He is impressed and happy for your confidence, although you can see that he is trembling, scared about the challenge ahead. <i>“I’ll do my best my Liege, I’ll be your loyal retainer!”</i> Great, if anything wrong goes with Celia, at least you’ll have a competent academic to take her place. So long he gets the right attitude to manage an university...\n\nYou do a small ceremonial act to confer him his new title, and after that is done, you decide to provide him with a retainer. You line up some of your servants, the ones that of course are not close to you and are even more submissive than him, and ask the Wallaby to pick one. He nervously walks in front of all of them, not sure of how to pick. <i>“As... Once they become my retainers, what’ll happen?”</i> Ah, interesting question, although you wonder if he doesn’t know or just wants to be sure he is understanding this right. Of course a retainer is not the same that having a slave, they are not property, but they’ll have the obligation to serve and protect him instead of you, but in exchange he’ll have to take care of them too, in this case with food and accommodation, among other things. <i>“B-But I cannot provide that!... Not with my salary, at least...”</i> He doesn’t have to worry, you’ll give him some lands that should provide enough to maintain him and even a couple of more servants.

That was not even the beginning.”</i> You can see fear in his face, but a huge erection under his pants tells another story. <i>“Uh... Don’t be shy boy, show me what you got too!”</i> she doesn’t even gives him the chance to act, using her dexterous tail to take his pants out, exposing him. <i>“Heh very cute, maybe I will give it a try...”</i> she smiles and grabs Virgil head, forcing him to give keep giving her head.\n\nYou can see how she moves her tail around his back <i>“Ready or not, here we go.”</i> The young man didn’t even know what was about to happen, but the sudden feeling of her tail up his ass awakes something inside him, changing his face to true delight and becoming more eager at his current task.

Now what’s a scene you don’t want to miss. \n\nYou thank the waitress on your way out and pay your bill. You catch the couple on their way to the university. Really, is not like he could go to another place. You shadow them close enough to listen their conversation, which is a pretty nerdy and banal conversation. \n\nWith the drugs and alcohol, they are not aware enough to spot you, or enough care about it, and when they enter the university he changes the topic of the conversation \n\n<i>“Hey do you want to play a game?”</i> says the Wallaby. The girl, confused, asks with an skeptic one <i>“Eh?... What kind of game?”</i> but he laughs. <i>“Don’t worry, is just a role playing game, you know what that is?”</i> she gets excited, and nods with energy <i>“Oh yes, of course I do! I played when I was younger but... There are not many people here that like that kind of things.”</i>\n\nVirgil slowly grabs her hand. At first she looks stiff, but at the end she grabs him back. They start to talk about their previous adventures, players, and other anecdotes, until they finally arrive to the university. \n\nThe whole place is empty, and you fear they might hear you thanks to the loud echo, but everything goes smooth, they are too distracted with their chat to pay attention. When they enter the library, they don’t even close the door.\n\nWithout much effort you spy on them. They keep the topic and he even brings some of his books. <i>“Would you like to play?”</i> he asks. <i>“Yeah but... only the two of us?”</i> he smiles <i>“Yeah, that’ll be fine.”</i>\n\nThey take some pencils, paper, and start to play and fool around.

Live Action Role Playing... Is like, the same, but acting instead of playing on paper.”</i> she laughs <i>“That sounds fun! Sure!”</i>. \n\nThey start to play, she is a villain while he is an hero.

She finally gives the first step. <i>“I cast Charm on you!”</i> Virgil takes a ridiculous pose, and then starts to slowly walk towards her, as if he was mind controlled, she grabs him by the chin. <i>“Finally, the hero is mine!”</i> she moves forward and kisses him. \n\nShe then walks back and lies down in a table, removing her underwear but keeps the dress, and she spreads her legs, exposing her wet cunt. <i>“Hurry Hero, and give me your seed!”</i> Virgil gets naked too, and you can see her licking her lips at the sight of his cock. \n\nHe walks forward, still in character, and slowly starts to penetrate her. She moans, but the dominant mistress doesn’t have enough. <i>“Faster! Harder! They dare to call you the chosen one? Such a wimp! Fuck me for real!”</i> he increases the pace at her command, until both start to moan very loud. \n\nInterestingly, she keeps her bitch face, and Virgil does his best to keep the poker face. Also, she never kisses him, probably because the motivation of the character isn’t love. Anyhow, she crosses her legs behind his back and starts to pull him over and over. <i>“Ah! Ah! I am cumming!”</i> he yells, and she pulls him one last time to make sure to receive his seed deep inside her. \n\nFinally, the game is over too, and both of them start to seem normal again. <i>“Ah... Ah... D-Did you have fun?”</i> he takes his dick out, and you can see the cream pie and mess he just did. <i>“Ah... Yes... It was something... Different...”</i> she grasps some air before continuing <i>“You think we can keep playing?”</i> he nods <i>“Yes... This... Well, this is usually a group thing but... Playing with you was pretty good.”</i> she smiles and puts her underwear on before standing up again. You can see some of his cum dripping down her right leg. <i>“Heh... A group thing. We’ll see about that. I’ll have to level up my charm spell first probably...”</i> both laugh and she kisses him in the cheek and start to have a friendly last words... What is wrong with this people?

But now it’s time for me to help you: First, what do you know about the many kingdoms in Caelia?”</i>\n\nAdmittedly, you don’t know much about history or the nuances of the island or your kingdom. Although your tutor did give you books and lessons on the subject, even he didn’t know much. You can’t blame him, he was a survivalist, not an scholar. \n\nStill, you recall that the island was home to many kingdoms and obviously races, but beyond knowing how to deal with them in combat, you recognize little else about them. \n\n<i>“So you truly know nothing... Very well, let’s address first the basics: There are, or were, many kingdoms, tribes, and cultures in Caelia. I say ‘were’ because ever since the outbreak we haven’t really had any contact with any of them, so it is hard to tell if they fallen apart or if they still exist.”</i>\n\nHe shows you a map, in it Aurorum is at the very bottom of the island, while the others were spread around. The map also points out where other tribes and towns are, although you know many of those have cease to exist already. \n\n<i>“I’m sure you know this already, but Aurorum is the kingdom of humans, although we’ve always accepted other races and hybrids in it, the population is predominantly human.”</i>\n\nHe points at the other end of the map, the biggest kingdom in the entire map. Compared to it, Aurorum is only barely noticeable. \n\n<i>“This is the kingdom of Saint Tapié, also known as The Citadel, and it is the kingdom of the Elves. Its surroundings are said to be blessed by the gods, with incredible forests and rich mountains they truly have the most powerful kingdom in the island. And to prove that fact they started and won a war that was named “The Unification War”, where they conquered the entire island and all kingdoms, including our own.”</i>\n\nYou tell him that you know more about this: That your uncle betrayed your father in order to give up the city to the elves, so long he was kept as governor of the city.\n\n<i>“That’s correct "+ GameControl.playerName +". The war was won easily by them, but the outbreak just five years later disintegrated their power, or at least in this part of the world. Now there are another 4 kingdoms”</i>\n\nHe points to the closest kingdom to Aurorum <i>“This is Ku-Jiang, a very rich although small kingdom. They are traders by nature and have the biggest port on the entire island under their control. It should be noted that they also have a reputation of being incredibly shady in their tactics.”</i>\n\nYou ask him if the caravans that come to the city come from Ku-Jiang. \n\n<i>“That is correct, "+ GameControl.playerName +", this is the only other kingdom we’ve confirmed that still stands. Nonetheless, news from them are always contradictory, probably to protect themselves from invasions, so we really don't know much about them. Maybe in the future you could send an emissary, or who knows, maybe go yourself!”</i>\n\nAlthough not a bad idea, you are still struggling too much getting everything together in your own kingdom to start diplomatic talks with another one. \n\nWhen he is done, he points to a very big jungle on the map with a big city at its heart. \n\n<i>“I guess that’s true... Well, let’s continue: This kingdom is the Tzime vice-royalty. They were a kingdom located in the heart of the jungle. Their story is complex and we may talk about that at another date... For now, suffice it to say that they were an impressive stronghold, originally ruled by native amazons who were later replaced by elves after the Unification War and transformed into an enormous prison for those who betrayed the empire.”</i>\n\nYou ask about the elves since you’ve faced many in the forest and they are well equipped and prepared, unlike other enemies that you’ve faced, but he shakes his head. \n\n<i>“We’ll talk about them in due time, but let’s get done with this first. I know it may be boring, but it’s what Celia asked me to teach you and I don’t want to piss her off...”</i>\n\n<i>“There are two kingdom left: Khaa-Rak Valladur, originally dominated by several tribes of ogres, orks, and beasts, none of which were all too intelligent, they were... well to avoid saying exterminated which isn’t completely accurate, let’s just say that they were ‘pacified’ during the war as well. The last kingdom left is be Wissenham, a truly impressive city that boasted many extraordinary tools and machinery, it also happens to be the city where alchemy was first discovered. It used to be a human kingdom too, but their experimentation with alchemy transformed it in a city of... abnormal creatures.”</i>\n\nVirgil barely talks about those last cities, but he thinks this should suffice. \n\n<i>“It was a very productive day, but there is still a lot left, please come back soon so we can finish these lessons so you can be ready to face Celia!”</i>\n\nYou ask if this is actually necessary at all or if she is going to test you or something. \n\n<i>“Er... To tell you the truth, I doubt she even cares. She probably was too busy to deal with you and decided to waste your time for a while. But believe me, if we don’t do this she’ll get angry and will refuse to met you anyway, so let’s do our best!”</i>\n\nYou nod and thank him for his time before you leave, telling him you’ll be back soon.";

			return "Another day, another lesson.\n\nToday Virgil wants to talk about the esoteric knowledge in the kingdom. Although he isn’t a practitioner himself, he knows about its history. \n\n<i>“We’re almost done with these sessions "+ GameControl.playerName +", but this is a topic that I believe is an especially important topic. Today we’ll be talking about alchemy, magic, and corruption.”</i>\n\nYou nod, considering all of the topics to be interesting, although still you don’t want to spent all of next week learning about them.\n\n<i>“Don’t worry, I’ll try to keep it short, lets begin.”</i>\n\nHe sits in front of you and starts <i>“So, let’s begin with magic. Magic has always been present in the world. It is a wild, powerful, and very volatile power that few people actually know how to use, let alone understand its true nature. You may have faced people who knows a trick or two, but they are nothing compared to a true sorcerer. As far as I know, there are none in our kingdom, so I’m afraid there is nowhere where you can learn to use magic.”</i>\n\nHe clearly doesn’t knows much about the topic, or even the nature of magic, all he knows is that it’s powerful and rare. \n\n<i>“Now about alchemy, that’s very well documented. This is a knowledge that’s been being developed for the last hundred years and many would say that it is still in its infancy. You’ve seen examples of it, potions that cure the sick, that transform the body, that corrupt... it’s full potential has still yet to be discovered, although some people blame it for the Outbreak.”</i>\n\nHe trembles a little bit, knowing that talking about corruption can be dangerous in and of itself.\n\n<i>“Let’s talk shortly about corruption; Corruption has always existed, every society has a record of its existence. No one knows why or how it happens: Some people use magic, alchemy, and other means to change the souls and minds of people. It was actually very uncommon in ancient times, it was surprising if it occurred even once every decade, but ever since the Outbreak we have had to deal with it every day.”</i>\n\nYou ask if he knows what the original cause of it was or if there are any clue about how to stop it.\n\n<i>“No and no. There is speculation about its origin: A powerful magic spell, punishments from a God, an alchemical experiment gone wrong. The truth is that right now it is more important to fight it than to research its source, since it emanates from everywhere now. There is some progress with alchemy to cure it, but it’s incredibly expensive and it doesn’t works all the time, although if you want to know more it would be better if you bring your inquiry to Lucretius, the city’s Grand Alchemist.”</i>\n\nYou think that would be a good idea and you may even do that once you have finished dealing with Celia.\n\n<i>“That would be great. I think this covers most of the topics, there is still one thing left, but we should leave that for later since I don’t want to cram too many differing subjects in your mind at once.”</i>\n\nYou can tell how tired he is with a look so you nod and thank him for his assistance. \n\n<i>“It’s a pleasure, I hope you come back soon my liege!”</i>";

One that looks pretty normal even if it has a fancy cover, the other is more like a... loose collection of notes bound together which is so poorly done that you seriously question if it even deserves to be called a book. \n\n<i>“Since we are running out of time, thanks to our unfortunate start, I think you should pick todays lecture.”</i> \n\nHe picks up the fancy book <i>“There has been some progress on philosophy these last decades, this is from an author named Vechiamalli, and is a very interesting lecture about how power should be handled. It could be said it is a guide about how to be a ruler and probably the most useful lecture about this topic...”</i> he puts the book down and take the other one. \n\n<i>“And this... Well, this is more like a manifest, it has been running around through the whole island and is credited to no one. Nonetheless, don’t be fooled by its presentation since this manuscript is very well written, and it has been in most places by its nature. The topic is the opposite of the other book: It’s about the importance of freedom, the oppression of culture, and the benefits of returning to our most primitive roots, instead of depending on a government, to let men and women to live by themselves.”</i> \n\nHe puts this book at the side of the fancy one. \n\n<i>“I’m not gonna lie, I haven’t had time to go deep into either of these books, so by the end we’ll both have learned something. So, which will it be?”</i>\n\nWhatever book you pick, it will influence Virgil too.";

			return "<i>“That is an appropriate choice, my Liege.”</i> He starts to talk about the different chapters contained within: About how a new ruler should govern, the role of the church and other social institutions, and the importance of a strong army. Of course, the book wouldn’t be complete if it didn’t talked about the virtues and the merits that any ruler who wishes to stay in power need possess.\n\nFor the next days you have lectures about all of these topics and the two of you have several discussions and debates, but in the end you both agree on the fundamentals, which is what matters.\n\nWhen you have finished combing through the book you have a better sense of what needs to be done in the city to improve on it’s current state. You also think to your past actions and wonder if they were indeed the right choices. Virgil comforts you <i>“You shouldn’t worry too much about that "+ GameControl.playerName +", I am sure you still have a chance to do the right thing in the future, just be careful from now on, each step can move you closer or further away, of your goal.”</i> You nod and thank him for the lesson, hopefully he is right and things will go well.

Yet there are many compelling and interesting thoughts contained within that make both of you question and debate for long hours every day that you study it. \n\nYou read the somewhat short text several times and each time it makes more sense than the last, giving you both an idea of how things can be applied on a larger scale to the city. It even makes you question some of your past actions, and you wonder if you made the right decisions in the past.
