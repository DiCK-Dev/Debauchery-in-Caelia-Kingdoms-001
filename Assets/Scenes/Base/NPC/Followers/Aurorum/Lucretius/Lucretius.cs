The letter was kinda cryptic and with an unusual and kinda excited tone, so you went with him as soon as you could.\n\nOnce there, he opens the door and pulls you inside with haste. <i>“Sorry my Liege, but we need some secrecy now.”</i> You ask why, what happened... and cut the crap, you don’t want to hear shenanigans. He sighs frustrated, but does so anyway. <i>“In short, I found an ancient ritual to change the very essence of the soul. After that, I spread some rumors about a mystical ritual that can enhance the life and performance of anyone, so now a group of nobles are in the basement waiting for me to perform the ritual itself. I think we can use them to form a secret cult that can help us spread the corruption from the very top to the bottom.”</i>\n\nYou pat his back, impressed by his work an ideas, and tell him if you should join them. <i>“Just take this hood and cover yourself, everyone else is doing that too. Beyond that, you stick with me at the sidelines.”</i>\n\nBoth of you go downstairs, into a very spacious room that has little to no decoration beyond a drawing on the floor and the ingredients for the ritual. There is a couple of torches, but they provide very little light. In the middle of the room there is a group of 5 individuals. Since everyone is using long robes, is hard to recognize them, but at least two of them have very voluptuous breasts and ass, that are noticeable even with the dim light and the loose and dark fabric. \n\nYou and Lucretius walk and stand in front of the circle. He gives a speech about the virtues of change among other things, and finally he starts the ritual with a chant. \n\nThe stones and crystals around the circle start to light up. At first the people in the middle is mumbling, but nothing happens. Then, suddenly, one of them falls to its knees and the rest followers shortly after. They yell, not of pain but of strangle, unnatural pleasure, their bodies spam with each litany sung. \n\nWhen the ritual is over, Lucretius falls exhausted, while the others are still in shock. <i>“I... I think it was successful.”</i> says the alchemist, but a sudden moaning takes your attention. They apparently had recovered faster, and you can see that their libido has awoken to a whole new level, to the point all of them start to fuck each other in an improvised orgy, with such haste they don't even bother to remove their robes but instead tearing apart whatever is on their way. \n\n<i>“Yes, definitely a success.

You explore his body, feeling it, knowing it. His balls are very full, he clearly hasn’t touched himself in a while, maybe even before anything happened, the alchemist too busy with his experiments to release his seed.\n\nHe turns his head around, his electric blue eyes meeting yours, his mouth slightly open, asking for more without a single word.

You ask, and he immediately lies down to the couch and raises his hips into the air, his dick aiming directly to his face. <i>“Please, help me out with this!”</i> he struggles to stay in that position, and he can’t properly take care of himself if he has to focus on keeping his body balanced. You walk towards and hold him from the waist, his testicles and curvy ass just in front of you.  With one hand he starts to masturbate, while he starts to fiddle with his ass with the other. \n\nAt first you are inactive, just amused by what is going on, but his loud moanings, the lustful face he is making, and the erotic sounds of him playing with himself are too much for you, and motivates you to join the fun. You remove the hand that’s in his ass and start to lick it. It’s tasteless, soft and porcelain-like body feels weird, but you get used to it pretty fast. You can see his swollen balls bounce with each of his strokes, and your turn your oral action between playing with his ass, and putting as much as you can of his balls inside your mouth. \n\n<i>“Ah yes "+ GameControl.playerName +"! Suck them! Keep doing that!”</i> The poor alchemist has lost all reason within himself and is only thinking about his own pleasure. It doesn't take long until he finish for the first time. <i>“Nggh!... Shit I’m cumming! Ahh!”</i> He opens his mouth and jets of cum go straight into his face. Some of them hit his mouth as intended, but at the end he just looks as if he had a bath with his own seed. Like he cares of the mass, since he is happily scooping for all the cum and drinking it. \n\n<i>“Such a huge load... I feel better now.”</i> With what just happened, he even forgot about what the potion was supposed to do, you ask him if he doesn’t care. <i>“Ah about that... You know, this experience... That potion did changed something, now I feel more attached to my new body than before, as if it belongs to me.”</i> he stands up, his cock still hard, but not desperate anymore. <i>“I’ll be fine, I believe that now.”</i> he gives you a sweet smile and walks towards you. <i>“Thanks for helping me today, I have to clean this mess, and I’m exhausted after working for the whole day, but come again soon "+ GameControl.playerName +", I’ll make it worth for you.”</i> he kisses you and grabs your ass, crotch, before letting you go. <i>“Don’t worry, and have some rest you too, you’ll be exhausted the next time you have to deal with me.”</i>";

He stays like that for more than an hour, until he is too tired to keep doing so. <i>“What was the mistake? What I did wrong?!”</i> you can hear frustration and ire in his voice, but at the end he has to accept his new reality. <i>“...If what I just did couldn’t solve it, I don’t know what will.”</i> You sit at this side and pat him in the back and tell him he has nothing to worry about, he did all he could, but even if his body won’t change back, he still has a clean soul. <i>“Do I?... I don’t know that... But I’m tired "+ GameControl.playerName +", I just want to sleep...”</i> Without saying anything else, you carry his frail body to his bed, and help cover him up with his bed sheets, as you had done several times already. \n\nYou are ready to leave, but he holds your hand. <i>“Thanks "+ GameControl.playerName +"... I fear what would had happen if you weren’t here with me today... I’ve failed but I’ll do my best to help your cause.”</i> he gives you his hand to shake it, and he gives you a smile. <i>“I’ll sleep now, but we can start working on your project as soon as tomorrow, no point on getting stuck on this plans too.”</i>\n\nYou leave the place, and although he cheered up at the end, you know he is just as devastated. At least working on your project will keep his head busy. \n";
